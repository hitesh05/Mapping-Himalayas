In time however, we reached the crest of &amp;e Gunhs Pass, extremely fhtigued, and not a little pleased in thinking we had so more +cent before us. A long and dreary may, .however, yet remained : as fa: as the eye could reach, a dismal expanse of spow met our view; the eun too was nearly set, and tbe temperature seqibly decreas~ng ; except my companion and myself, with one or two servants, none had yet reached the crest of the pass : most of the hill carriers bad indeed arrived at th~ foot of it, but there they stood with despairing countenances alike unwilling and unable to ascend the lofty scarp which still remained to be surmounted. A report, too, was brought us, that one of .them was taken ill,, and was unable to proceed.

On pro- mising a rupee for each load that should be recovered, the carriers set off in high spirits, and in the course of the day every thing was brought in. The day was fine, and we had an opportunity of looking about us and ad- miring the scene ; a scanty pasturage, .on which a few herds of yaks weie seen grazing, and some bushes of the dog briar, were all that we saw in the shape of vegetation. The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ Bassa, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the Baspa nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp. Although the elevation did not much exceed 13,000 feet, so great was the cold even at this season of the year,. that all the streams were frozen, and during the evening a heavy fall of snow came. 350 COURSE AND LEVELS on, and gave us an opportunity of congratulating each. bther that we hd rid deferred the passage of.the range. This snow storm interrupted a hip we. 1 had contemplated making to revisit the pass, and which we put into ere+' cution the following morning. We found the distanceaboutfour miles and% half, which occupied ue three hours, being continued ascent wd #atha steep latterly. . , . .1 Undisturbed by anxiety, we now found ourselves with sufficient le'rsnre ta observe and to enjoy this singular scene. Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the Andes themselves sink , into inferiority. Their nearness and consequent great apparent magnitude, the idea that we were now close to objects so often viewed from great dis- tances, and which had so often exercised conjecture ; these and a thousand other circumstances gave an interest to the scene, that it is difficult to corn- ' municate by any description. On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the Himalaya is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the Baspa, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the Baspa, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of Kailas, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term Kailas,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface. This peculiarity of appearance 1 liave almost afkays observed in snow that is situated abovb the limit of congelation. We endeavoured to guess at its depth, by sounding with our longest sticks', bat, though assisted by the whole length of the arm up to the shoultier, we could not touch ground. Indeed as it is hardly to be eupyosed that .this snow melts jn any quantity to be compared with what'falls annually, it-must be considered as the accumulation of ages. It 3s evident, notwith- I standing the elevation, that a small quantity does melt, for a t'hermometer ' hung dose to the surface of the snow, the sun sbi~ing on it, rose above 600 : atiii the yearly supplies must greatly exceed the waste, so that we may, without hazarding an error,'well suppose it on the increase., The thermo- meter in the shade was 370. Towards noon we returned to Camp, and fie following morning quitted this' inhospitable (pot.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (Sangla) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width. On this side, were seen immense forests do- to the very edge of the water ; on that, the more open and well conhsted appearaace of successive table lands rising from ke river bed, cultivated, and their borders shaded by poplars and willows, while in the middle of two of the largest, the eye rested on two substantial villages, containing each npt leas than eighty houses ; below, every thing was green and smiling, but as the eye rose, it once more encountered the black and nake'd racks, and, still higher, the eternal snows of the frost bound Himalaya. we arossed the Baspa, the river above noticed, on a well,boarded, and railed sanga , . ninety-one feet in length, and took up our quarters in the nearer of the two villages, Sangla. The distance was seven miles and three-quarters, the +hole a considerable, though not steep, descent. We were now in Kanbwer, a purgunnah of the mountain state Biseahir. Previously to entering into any detail of our journey over t11,is newground, , 1 it'may be proper to throw, together a few particulars, which though the re- sult . of .. the journey, and consequently not in order here, strictly speakin&amp;, mdy .. yet rdnder what follows more intelligible. *KanBwer comprehends the valley of the Setlej aud ita principal feeders, frond lat. 310 33; long. 770 47'; to lat. 310 51; long. 780 422 on the north ad r. cast it is contern~inous with the Chinese.possessions, and on the west wit11 'the Tartar p~zrgunnah of Hangareng, also subject to Bissahir, with Ladak, l and with KGllG, a mountain state situate on the right bank of the Setlej, "and now subject to Runjeet Sinh. It may be said to be entirely within the Himalaya range, though extending from north to south forty-three miles; for, on the south, it has tlie ridge that had been crossed, the peaks of which have an elevation of from 19 to 2 1,000 feet, ~~T-i~iie to the north of it is seen , , 'the Purkyul ritlge, tlie highest peak of which is near 22,000 feet high. The 'villages are not numerous, but tbey are some of them more substantial than .are generally seen in the mountains. KBnam and Sungnam are two of the largest, and contain about a hundred families . . each. The houses are built of Bewn stone, with occasional layers of the Deodar pine, which at the corners ' are fastened with wooden keys. The roofs in the lower part of Kanawer are sloping, and formed of shingles ; in the upper part, where violent winds prevail, they are flat and covered with earth; the former are generally two , btories liigh, sonletimes three ad even four, with a balcony on one or two sides, in the latter they are seldom more than one. Still farther north of it is tari, in Ladak ; the houses are built of unburnt bricks; the climate being ' such that little rain or even snow ever f'ctlls.. . t .Some of the villages are situated in the immediate valley of the river; many in the glens watered by the large feeders which derive their sup- plies from the snows of the Himalaya; their elevation is generally from 8 to MOO feet, though some are much below and others much above this ,esti- mate. The soil appears to be totally diBerent from that of the southern mountain provinces. The grape cannot be naturalized by any eflorts or any care out of Kan6wer '(within the mountains I mean;) the Neozir pine, the seeds of which are excellent and form a valuable article of export, is not . to be found beyond the limits of this tract. The turnip too attains a per- fection in KanAwer which it' wants elsewhere ; and the apples are alone . those, within the circuit of the mountains, worthy of a comparison with tbe -. . 8 a 554 COURSE AND LEVELS s,une fruit in England. Of grains they have the usual varieties, most of wllich are mentioned by hfr. Moorcroft. Wheat, barley, chenna, paphro, . ora ; of these the latter is valuable for its hardiness, flourishing in climates where no other grain will live. Barley is fouucl at great elevations ah Qf wheat they do not appear to hale much. The people of Kanfitver are tall and rather handsome, with expressive countenances ; they are not, however, so fair as I shoulcl have expected to find them in so cold a climate. Their manners are good'; they am open , and communicative without being deficient in respect. They are almost all  trader^, and consequently great travellers, visiting Leh, Garii, and the othet marts, chiefly for salt an3 wool. Their export. are grain, much of which they receive from the lower mountains, raisins, neozas, iron, and broad .cloth, which they obtain at Kotgerh, kc. They possess a degree of wealth and consequence wldch no other mountain tribe has attained to ; their lan- guage is essentially different from that of the Tartars, and has even no afii- nity with the other mountain dialects ; whether it be related to any of tlle dialects of the south is a pint on which 1 am unable to offer any opinion. The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the Baspa, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from Murang through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, Siia and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. Sua or Sijang, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the Basya, and contains the following villages : KamrG or Mohni, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses. Singla, - . -- - - - 70 or 80 ditto. Chilknl, - 4 ditto. Rakcllall,. - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 ditto. . . Barsini, - - - - - - - - - - - - ]dillo, The last three are towards the head of the river ; Cllilk111 being three days marc11 of about seven miles each ; Rakchan about ser-en miles, and ' Barsini about three miles, or two and a half.

The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ Bassa, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the Baspa nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp.

Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the Andes themselves sink , into inferiority. Their nearness and consequent great apparent magnitude, the idea that we were now close to objects so often viewed from great dis- tances, and which had so often exercised conjecture ; these and a thousand other circumstances gave an interest to the scene, that it is difficult to corn- ' municate by any description. On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the Himalaya is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the Baspa, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the Baspa, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of Kailas, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term Kailas,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (Sangla) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width. On this side, were seen immense forests do- to the very edge of the water ; on that, the more open and well conhsted appearaace of successive table lands rising from ke river bed, cultivated, and their borders shaded by poplars and willows, while in the middle of two of the largest, the eye rested on two substantial villages, containing each npt leas than eighty houses ; below, every thing was green and smiling, but as the eye rose, it once more encountered the black and nake'd racks, and, still higher, the eternal snows of the frost bound Himalaya. we arossed the Baspa, the river above noticed, on a well,boarded, and railed sanga , . ninety-one feet in length, and took up our quarters in the nearer of the two villages, Sangla. The distance was seven miles and three-quarters, the +hole a considerable, though not steep, descent. We were now in Kanbwer, a purgunnah of the mountain state Biseahir. Previously to entering into any detail of our journey over t11,is newground, , 1 it'may be proper to throw, together a few particulars, which though the re- sult . of .. the journey, and consequently not in order here, strictly speakin&amp;, mdy .. yet rdnder what follows more intelligible. *KanBwer comprehends the valley of the Setlej aud ita principal feeders, frond lat. 310 33; long. 770 47'; to lat. 310 51; long. 780 422 on the north ad r. cast it is contern~inous with the Chinese.possessions, and on the west wit11 'the Tartar p~zrgunnah of Hangareng, also subject to Bissahir, with Ladak, l and with KGllG, a mountain state situate on the right bank of the Setlej, "and now subject to Runjeet Sinh. It may be said to be entirely within the Himalaya range, though extending from north to south forty-three miles; for, on the south, it has tlie ridge that had been crossed, the peaks of which have an elevation of from 19 to 2 1,000 feet, ~~T-i~iie to the north of it is seen , , 'the Purkyul ritlge, tlie highest peak of which is near 22,000 feet high. The 'villages are not numerous, but tbey are some of them more substantial than .are generally seen in the mountains. KBnam and Sungnam are two of the largest, and contain about a hundred families . . each. The houses are built of Bewn stone, with occasional layers of the Deodar pine, which at the corners ' are fastened with wooden keys. The roofs in the lower part of Kanawer are sloping, and formed of shingles ; in the upper part, where violent winds prevail, they are flat and covered with earth; the former are generally two , btories liigh, sonletimes three ad even four, with a balcony on one or two sides, in the latter they are seldom more than one. Still farther north of it is tari, in Ladak ; the houses are built of unburnt bricks; the climate being ' such that little rain or even snow ever f'ctlls.. . t .Some of the villages are situated in the immediate valley of the river; many in the glens watered by the large feeders which derive their sup- plies from the snows of the Himalaya; their elevation is generally from 8 to MOO feet, though some are much below and others much above this ,esti- mate. The soil appears to be totally diBerent from that of the southern mountain provinces. The grape cannot be naturalized by any eflorts or any care out of Kan6wer '(within the mountains I mean;) the Neozir pine, the seeds of which are excellent and form a valuable article of export, is not . to be found beyond the limits of this tract. The turnip too attains a per- fection in KanAwer which it' wants elsewhere ; and the apples are alone . those, within the circuit of the mountains, worthy of a comparison with tbe -. . 8 a 554 COURSE AND LEVELS s,une fruit in England. Of grains they have the usual varieties, most of wllich are mentioned by hfr. Moorcroft. Wheat, barley, chenna, paphro, . ora ; of these the latter is valuable for its hardiness, flourishing in climates where no other grain will live. Barley is fouucl at great elevations ah Qf wheat they do not appear to hale much. The people of Kanfitver are tall and rather handsome, with expressive countenances ; they are not, however, so fair as I shoulcl have expected to find them in so cold a climate. Their manners are good'; they am open , and communicative without being deficient in respect. They are almost all  trader^, and consequently great travellers, visiting Leh, Garii, and the othet marts, chiefly for salt an3 wool. Their export. are grain, much of which they receive from the lower mountains, raisins, neozas, iron, and broad .cloth, which they obtain at Kotgerh, kc. They possess a degree of wealth and consequence wldch no other mountain tribe has attained to ; their lan- guage is essentially different from that of the Tartars, and has even no afii- nity with the other mountain dialects ; whether it be related to any of tlle dialects of the south is a pint on which 1 am unable to offer any opinion. The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the Baspa, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from Murang through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, Siia and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. Sua or Sijang, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the Basya, and contains the following villages : KamrG or Mohni, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses. Singla, - . -- - - - 70 or 80 ditto. Chilknl, - 4 ditto. Rakcllall,. - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 ditto. . . Barsini, - - - - - - - - - - - - ]dillo, The last three are towards the head of the river ; Cllilk111 being three days marc11 of about seven miles each ; Rakchan about ser-en miles, and ' Barsini about three miles, or two and a half.

The elevation of the place was 5 1,281 feet above thesea, which qay therefore be considered as the heigbt of this limit: several cares,'or overhanging ,rocks, capable of affording shelter to our followers; induced' us to Falt here, tlie evening being- far advanced and no firewood procurable aihead. . The night .was very cold, and in.the morning the thetmometer vas down to ,340 ; my companiop shot here a punql, which eorded us an .eqcellept dinner. . ., \ As we-had a-long and fatiguing march before us, we thought it advisable $to take some'refreshment before setting out.' Accordingly, it was near ten o'clock b efore we were firirly in motion. The narrow valley already des- cribed continues for a mile and a half further; the river broad but shallow, +-~~ing.litfle current. Fragments of every size, and of every kind of gra- nite or gneiss, were strewed about ; amongst them, some very brilliant, if not beautiful, specimens were abserved, in which the plates of mica were of an unusual size. The valley vas terminated by the ridge, apparently, of the Himalaya itself, -rising in front of us, from the face of which, the river ap- peared .to *issue in a noble cataract of two falls from 100 to 120 feet each. We ascended by a winding path to theIhead of these falls, which were sup- plied .by %he partial melting of the vat mass of snow that-filled the com- pass oflhe eye on whichever side it was directed. We were now at the \ imrilediate foot of this range, and all before us, to the very summit, was snbm. The first pa&amp; of our progress up this steep ascent, was -1ittIe im- pe4ed by&amp; ; it was scanty though soft.

To add to our perplexity, the sky became overcast, black clouds collected overhead,$and at one time I even thought I felt a flake of snow, descend up-on my-outstretched hand - . . 3 ... , ..

Fortnnatelp the alarm proved. a false~one; but the clouds continuing to.,collect and darken overhead, imdticed us to : use the utmost .expedition, that,. ig possible, we might reach the.other side of the pass before a change of weather should take.plaoe;. towards evening , . we discovered the summit rising in a wd'.of snow-to-.the height of about Rr2 I COURSE AND LEVEW 800 feet. ,To surmount this ascent required the most arduoas exertion, and we floundered about till nearly exhausted, in a soft acclivity of snow, lying at an angle of about 300. In time however, we reached the crest of &amp;e Gunhs Pass, extremely fhtigued, and not a little pleased in thinking we had so more +cent before us. A long and dreary may, .however, yet remained : as fa: as the eye could reach, a dismal expanse of spow met our view; the eun too was nearly set, and tbe temperature seqibly decreas~ng ; except my companion and myself, with one or two servants, none had yet reached the crest of the pass : most of the hill carriers bad indeed arrived at th~ foot of it, but there they stood with despairing countenances alike unwilling and unable to ascend the lofty scarp which still remained to be surmounted. A report, too, was brought us, that one of .them was taken ill,, and was unable to proceed. It became therefore necessary to gbandon .the baggage, as giving the only ,chance of our followers getting over their di@culties. before night fall.

In time however, we reached the crest of &amp;e Gunhs Pass, extremely fhtigued, and not a little pleased in thinking we had so more +cent before us. A long and dreary may, .however, yet remained : as fa: as the eye could reach, a dismal expanse of spow met our view; the eun too was nearly set, and tbe temperature seqibly decreas~ng ; except my companion and myself, with one or two servants, none had yet reached the crest of the pass : most of the hill carriers bad indeed arrived at th~ foot of it, but there they stood with despairing countenances alike unwilling and unable to ascend the lofty scarp which still remained to be surmounted. A report, too, was brought us, that one of .them was taken ill,, and was unable to proceed. It became therefore necessary to gbandon .the baggage, as giving the only ,chance of our followers getting over their di@culties. before night fall. It was not Ivithout some trouble we could get them to understand this mea- sure, so that it was nearly dark before bhey w,ere fairly across.

The mow too was suficiently . hard to render the footing more lirm .than it had been in the former part of the journey, and being a desqnt the-whole way, there was no cause what- ever for apprehension or dismay ; the people were however not the less .alarmed, some 4at down and cried, others were prevented from lying down in the snow only by thr-, agd all, with ~.wy few exceptioas, looked frightened in no small degree.

On pro- mising a rupee for each load that should be recovered, the carriers set off in high spirits, and in the course of the day every thing was brought in. The day was fine, and we had an opportunity of looking about us and ad- miring the scene ; a scanty pasturage, .on which a few herds of yaks weie seen grazing, and some bushes of the dog briar, were all that we saw in the shape of vegetation. The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ Bassa, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the Baspa nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp. Although the elevation did not much exceed 13,000 feet, so great was the cold even at this season of the year,. that all the streams were frozen, and during the evening a heavy fall of snow came. 350 COURSE AND LEVELS on, and gave us an opportunity of congratulating each. bther that we hd rid deferred the passage of.the range. This snow storm interrupted a hip we. 1 had contemplated making to revisit the pass, and which we put into ere+' cution the following morning. We found the distanceaboutfour miles and% half, which occupied ue three hours, being continued ascent wd #atha steep latterly. . , . .1 Undisturbed by anxiety, we now found ourselves with sufficient le'rsnre ta observe and to enjoy this singular scene. Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the Andes themselves sink , into inferiority. Their nearness and consequent great apparent magnitude, the idea that we were now close to objects so often viewed from great dis- tances, and which had so often exercised conjecture ; these and a thousand other circumstances gave an interest to the scene, that it is difficult to corn- ' municate by any description. On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the Himalaya is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the Baspa, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the Baspa, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of Kailas, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term Kailas,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface. This peculiarity of appearance 1 liave almost afkays observed in snow that is situated abovb the limit of congelation. We endeavoured to guess at its depth, by sounding with our longest sticks', bat, though assisted by the whole length of the arm up to the shoultier, we could not touch ground. Indeed as it is hardly to be eupyosed that .this snow melts jn any quantity to be compared with what'falls annually, it-must be considered as the accumulation of ages. It 3s evident, notwith- I standing the elevation, that a small quantity does melt, for a t'hermometer ' hung dose to the surface of the snow, the sun sbi~ing on it, rose above 600 : atiii the yearly supplies must greatly exceed the waste, so that we may, without hazarding an error,'well suppose it on the increase., The thermo- meter in the shade was 370.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (Sangla) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width.

The day was fine, and we had an opportunity of looking about us and ad- miring the scene ; a scanty pasturage, .on which a few herds of yaks weie seen grazing, and some bushes of the dog briar, were all that we saw in the shape of vegetation. The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ Bassa, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the Baspa nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp. Although the elevation did not much exceed 13,000 feet, so great was the cold even at this season of the year,. that all the streams were frozen, and during the evening a heavy fall of snow came. 350 COURSE AND LEVELS on, and gave us an opportunity of congratulating each. bther that we hd rid deferred the passage of.the range.

We found the distanceaboutfour miles and% half, which occupied ue three hours, being continued ascent wd #atha steep latterly. . , . .1 Undisturbed by anxiety, we now found ourselves with sufficient le'rsnre ta observe and to enjoy this singular scene. Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the Andes themselves sink , into inferiority. Their nearness and consequent great apparent magnitude, the idea that we were now close to objects so often viewed from great dis- tances, and which had so often exercised conjecture ; these and a thousand other circumstances gave an interest to the scene, that it is difficult to corn- ' municate by any description. On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the Himalaya is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the Baspa, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the Baspa, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of Kailas, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term Kailas,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface. This peculiarity of appearance 1 liave almost afkays observed in snow that is situated abovb the limit of congelation. We endeavoured to guess at its depth, by sounding with our longest sticks', bat, though assisted by the whole length of the arm up to the shoultier, we could not touch ground. Indeed as it is hardly to be eupyosed that .this snow melts jn any quantity to be compared with what'falls annually, it-must be considered as the accumulation of ages. It 3s evident, notwith- I standing the elevation, that a small quantity does melt, for a t'hermometer ' hung dose to the surface of the snow, the sun sbi~ing on it, rose above 600 : atiii the yearly supplies must greatly exceed the waste, so that we may, without hazarding an error,'well suppose it on the increase., The thermo- meter in the shade was 370.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (Sangla) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width. On this side, were seen immense forests do- to the very edge of the water ; on that, the more open and well conhsted appearaace of successive table lands rising from ke river bed, cultivated, and their borders shaded by poplars and willows, while in the middle of two of the largest, the eye rested on two substantial villages, containing each npt leas than eighty houses ; below, every thing was green and smiling, but as the eye rose, it once more encountered the black and nake'd racks, and, still higher, the eternal snows of the frost bound Himalaya. we arossed the Baspa, the river above noticed, on a well,boarded, and railed sanga , . ninety-one feet in length, and took up our quarters in the nearer of the two villages, Sangla. The distance was seven miles and three-quarters, the +hole a considerable, though not steep, descent. We were now in Kanbwer, a purgunnah of the mountain state Biseahir. Previously to entering into any detail of our journey over t11,is newground, , 1 it'may be proper to throw, together a few particulars, which though the re- sult . of .. the journey, and consequently not in order here, strictly speakin&amp;, mdy .. yet rdnder what follows more intelligible. *KanBwer comprehends the valley of the Setlej aud ita principal feeders, frond lat. 310 33; long. 770 47'; to lat. 310 51; long. 780 422 on the north ad r. cast it is contern~inous with the Chinese.possessions, and on the west wit11 'the Tartar p~zrgunnah of Hangareng, also subject to Bissahir, with Ladak, l and with KGllG, a mountain state situate on the right bank of the Setlej, "and now subject to Runjeet Sinh. It may be said to be entirely within the Himalaya range, though extending from north to south forty-three miles; for, on the south, it has tlie ridge that had been crossed, the peaks of which have an elevation of from 19 to 2 1,000 feet, ~~T-i~iie to the north of it is seen , , 'the Purkyul ritlge, tlie highest peak of which is near 22,000 feet high. The 'villages are not numerous, but tbey are some of them more substantial than .are generally seen in the mountains. KBnam and Sungnam are two of the largest, and contain about a hundred families . . each. The houses are built of Bewn stone, with occasional layers of the Deodar pine, which at the corners ' are fastened with wooden keys. The roofs in the lower part of Kanawer are sloping, and formed of shingles ; in the upper part, where violent winds prevail, they are flat and covered with earth; the former are generally two , btories liigh, sonletimes three ad even four, with a balcony on one or two sides, in the latter they are seldom more than one. Still farther north of it is tari, in Ladak ; the houses are built of unburnt bricks; the climate being ' such that little rain or even snow ever f'ctlls.. . t .Some of the villages are situated in the immediate valley of the river; many in the glens watered by the large feeders which derive their sup- plies from the snows of the Himalaya; their elevation is generally from 8 to MOO feet, though some are much below and others much above this ,esti- mate. The soil appears to be totally diBerent from that of the southern mountain provinces. The grape cannot be naturalized by any eflorts or any care out of Kan6wer '(within the mountains I mean;) the Neozir pine, the seeds of which are excellent and form a valuable article of export, is not . to be found beyond the limits of this tract. The turnip too attains a per- fection in KanAwer which it' wants elsewhere ; and the apples are alone . those, within the circuit of the mountains, worthy of a comparison with tbe -. . 8 a 554 COURSE AND LEVELS s,une fruit in England. Of grains they have the usual varieties, most of wllich are mentioned by hfr. Moorcroft. Wheat, barley, chenna, paphro, . ora ; of these the latter is valuable for its hardiness, flourishing in climates where no other grain will live. Barley is fouucl at great elevations ah Qf wheat they do not appear to hale much. The people of Kanfitver are tall and rather handsome, with expressive countenances ; they are not, however, so fair as I shoulcl have expected to find them in so cold a climate. Their manners are good'; they am open , and communicative without being deficient in respect. They are almost all  trader^, and consequently great travellers, visiting Leh, Garii, and the othet marts, chiefly for salt an3 wool. Their export. are grain, much of which they receive from the lower mountains, raisins, neozas, iron, and broad .cloth, which they obtain at Kotgerh, kc. They possess a degree of wealth and consequence wldch no other mountain tribe has attained to ; their lan- guage is essentially different from that of the Tartars, and has even no afii- nity with the other mountain dialects ; whether it be related to any of tlle dialects of the south is a pint on which 1 am unable to offer any opinion. The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the Baspa, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from Murang through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, Siia and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. Sua or Sijang, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the Basya, and contains the following villages : KamrG or Mohni, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses. Singla, - . -- - - - 70 or 80 ditto. Chilknl, - 4 ditto. Rakcllall,. - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 ditto. . .

On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the Himalaya is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the Baspa, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the Baspa, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of Kailas, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term Kailas,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface. This peculiarity of appearance 1 liave almost afkays observed in snow that is situated abovb the limit of congelation. We endeavoured to guess at its depth, by sounding with our longest sticks', bat, though assisted by the whole length of the arm up to the shoultier, we could not touch ground. Indeed as it is hardly to be eupyosed that .this snow melts jn any quantity to be compared with what'falls annually, it-must be considered as the accumulation of ages. It 3s evident, notwith- I standing the elevation, that a small quantity does melt, for a t'hermometer ' hung dose to the surface of the snow, the sun sbi~ing on it, rose above 600 : atiii the yearly supplies must greatly exceed the waste, so that we may, without hazarding an error,'well suppose it on the increase., The thermo- meter in the shade was 370.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (Sangla) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width. On this side, were seen immense forests do- to the very edge of the water ; on that, the more open and well conhsted appearaace of successive table lands rising from ke river bed, cultivated, and their borders shaded by poplars and willows, while in the middle of two of the largest, the eye rested on two substantial villages, containing each npt leas than eighty houses ; below, every thing was green and smiling, but as the eye rose, it once more encountered the black and nake'd racks, and, still higher, the eternal snows of the frost bound Himalaya. we arossed the Baspa, the river above noticed, on a well,boarded, and railed sanga , . ninety-one feet in length, and took up our quarters in the nearer of the two villages, Sangla. The distance was seven miles and three-quarters, the +hole a considerable, though not steep, descent. We were now in Kanbwer, a purgunnah of the mountain state Biseahir. Previously to entering into any detail of our journey over t11,is newground, , 1 it'may be proper to throw, together a few particulars, which though the re- sult . of .. the journey, and consequently not in order here, strictly speakin&amp;, mdy .. yet rdnder what follows more intelligible. *KanBwer comprehends the valley of the Setlej aud ita principal feeders, frond lat. 310 33; long. 770 47'; to lat. 310 51; long. 780 422 on the north ad r. cast it is contern~inous with the Chinese.possessions, and on the west wit11 'the Tartar p~zrgunnah of Hangareng, also subject to Bissahir, with Ladak, l and with KGllG, a mountain state situate on the right bank of the Setlej, "and now subject to Runjeet Sinh. It may be said to be entirely within the Himalaya range, though extending from north to south forty-three miles; for, on the south, it has tlie ridge that had been crossed, the peaks of which have an elevation of from 19 to 2 1,000 feet, ~~T-i~iie to the north of it is seen , , 'the Purkyul ritlge, tlie highest peak of which is near 22,000 feet high. The 'villages are not numerous, but tbey are some of them more substantial than .are generally seen in the mountains. KBnam and Sungnam are two of the largest, and contain about a hundred families . . each. The houses are built of Bewn stone, with occasional layers of the Deodar pine, which at the corners ' are fastened with wooden keys. The roofs in the lower part of Kanawer are sloping, and formed of shingles ; in the upper part, where violent winds prevail, they are flat and covered with earth; the former are generally two , btories liigh, sonletimes three ad even four, with a balcony on one or two sides, in the latter they are seldom more than one. Still farther north of it is tari, in Ladak ; the houses are built of unburnt bricks; the climate being ' such that little rain or even snow ever f'ctlls.. . t .Some of the villages are situated in the immediate valley of the river; many in the glens watered by the large feeders which derive their sup- plies from the snows of the Himalaya; their elevation is generally from 8 to MOO feet, though some are much below and others much above this ,esti- mate. The soil appears to be totally diBerent from that of the southern mountain provinces. The grape cannot be naturalized by any eflorts or any care out of Kan6wer '(within the mountains I mean;) the Neozir pine, the seeds of which are excellent and form a valuable article of export, is not . to be found beyond the limits of this tract. The turnip too attains a per- fection in KanAwer which it' wants elsewhere ; and the apples are alone . those, within the circuit of the mountains, worthy of a comparison with tbe -. . 8 a 554 COURSE AND LEVELS s,une fruit in England. Of grains they have the usual varieties, most of wllich are mentioned by hfr. Moorcroft. Wheat, barley, chenna, paphro, . ora ; of these the latter is valuable for its hardiness, flourishing in climates where no other grain will live. Barley is fouucl at great elevations ah Qf wheat they do not appear to hale much. The people of Kanfitver are tall and rather handsome, with expressive countenances ; they are not, however, so fair as I shoulcl have expected to find them in so cold a climate. Their manners are good'; they am open , and communicative without being deficient in respect. They are almost all  trader^, and consequently great travellers, visiting Leh, Garii, and the othet marts, chiefly for salt an3 wool. Their export. are grain, much of which they receive from the lower mountains, raisins, neozas, iron, and broad .cloth, which they obtain at Kotgerh, kc. They possess a degree of wealth and consequence wldch no other mountain tribe has attained to ; their lan- guage is essentially different from that of the Tartars, and has even no afii- nity with the other mountain dialects ; whether it be related to any of tlle dialects of the south is a pint on which 1 am unable to offer any opinion. The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the Baspa, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from Murang through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, Siia and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. Sua or Sijang, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the Basya, and contains the following villages : KamrG or Mohni, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses.

The elevation of the place was 5 1,281 feet above thesea, which qay therefore be considered as the heigbt of this limit: several cares,'or overhanging ,rocks, capable of affording shelter to our followers; induced' us to Falt here, tlie evening being- far advanced and no firewood procurable aihead. . The night .was very cold, and in.the morning the thetmometer vas down to ,340 ; my companiop shot here a punql, which eorded us an .eqcellept dinner. . ., \ As we-had a-long and fatiguing march before us, we thought it advisable $to take some'refreshment before setting out.' Accordingly, it was near ten o'clock b efore we were firirly in motion. The narrow valley already des- cribed continues for a mile and a half further; the river broad but shallow, +-~~ing.litfle current. Fragments of every size, and of every kind of gra- nite or gneiss, were strewed about ; amongst them, some very brilliant, if not beautiful, specimens were abserved, in which the plates of mica were of an unusual size. The valley vas terminated by the ridge, apparently, of the Himalaya itself, -rising in front of us, from the face of which, the river ap- peared .to *issue in a noble cataract of two falls from 100 to 120 feet each. We ascended by a winding path to theIhead of these falls, which were sup- plied .by %he partial melting of the vat mass of snow that-filled the com- pass oflhe eye on whichever side it was directed. We were now at the \ imrilediate foot of this range, and all before us, to the very summit, was snbm. The first pa&amp; of our progress up this steep ascent, was -1ittIe im- pe4ed by&amp; ; it was scanty though soft.

To add to our perplexity, the sky became overcast, black clouds collected overhead,$and at one time I even thought I felt a flake of snow, descend up-on my-outstretched hand - . . 3 ... , ..

Fortnnatelp the alarm proved. a false~one; but the clouds continuing to.,collect and darken overhead, imdticed us to : use the utmost .expedition, that,. ig possible, we might reach the.other side of the pass before a change of weather should take.plaoe;. towards evening , . we discovered the summit rising in a wd'.of snow-to-.the height of about Rr2 I COURSE AND LEVEW 800 feet. ,To surmount this ascent required the most arduoas exertion, and we floundered about till nearly exhausted, in a soft acclivity of snow, lying at an angle of about 300. In time however, we reached the crest of &amp;e Gunhs Pass, extremely fhtigued, and not a little pleased in thinking we had so more +cent before us. A long and dreary may, .however, yet remained : as fa: as the eye could reach, a dismal expanse of spow met our view; the eun too was nearly set, and tbe temperature seqibly decreas~ng ; except my companion and myself, with one or two servants, none had yet reached the crest of the pass : most of the hill carriers bad indeed arrived at th~ foot of it, but there they stood with despairing countenances alike unwilling and unable to ascend the lofty scarp which still remained to be surmounted. A report, too, was brought us, that one of .them was taken ill,, and was unable to proceed. It became therefore necessary to gbandon .the baggage, as giving the only ,chance of our followers getting over their di@culties. before night fall. It was not Ivithout some trouble we could get them to understand this mea- sure, so that it was nearly dark before bhey w,ere fairly across. The moos rose, however, nearly full, an4 her.light, reflected from the expanse of snow, left little fear of aur mistaking nur way. The mow too was suficiently . hard to render the footing more lirm .than it had been in the former part of the journey, and being a desqnt the-whole way, there was no cause what- ever for apprehension or dismay ; the people were however not the less .alarmed, some 4at down and cried, others were prevented from lying down in the snow only by thr-, agd all, with ~.wy few exceptioas, looked frightened in no small degree.

On pro- mising a rupee for each load that should be recovered, the carriers set off in high spirits, and in the course of the day every thing was brought in. The day was fine, and we had an opportunity of looking about us and ad- miring the scene ; a scanty pasturage, .on which a few herds of yaks weie seen grazing, and some bushes of the dog briar, were all that we saw in the shape of vegetation. The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ Bassa, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the Baspa nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp. Although the elevation did not much exceed 13,000 feet, so great was the cold even at this season of the year,. that all the streams were frozen, and during the evening a heavy fall of snow came. 350 COURSE AND LEVELS on, and gave us an opportunity of congratulating each. bther that we hd rid deferred the passage of.the range.

Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the Andes themselves sink , into inferiority.

The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the Baspa, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from Murang through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, Siia and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. Sua or Sijang, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the Basya, and contains the following villages : KamrG or Mohni, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses.

    From Nako to (3hang was a distance of one hundred and five miles; the path is' good the whole way, and the ascent which coptinues the first half, and descent' kop thence to Chang, are both easy ; several flats and hollows are seen in OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. Sil the vicinity .of Nako, and close to the village there is a small.lake of consi- derable depth. The declivity of the ridge is here very gentle, though on the opposite side of the river the steepness is established by the appearance of the road not leading along its face, but over the lateral ridges and descend- ing into the glens. At Chaq there is the same flat declivity ; on this side, red hard earth is seen to form hillocks that rise above the surrounding ter- rein, similar to turrets or the bastions of a fort. Chang is situated in the middle of a little flat, which might be almost called a valley ; .it is in some measure, or has been, the bed of a torrent, but the stream now flows deep below and far away to the right. To the left this valley is bounded by a. ridge of the hard clay, I have already mentioned, which separated it from. the collection of hillocks. Looking up in the direction of the glen, which has a very gradual acclivity, ad flat and retiring sides, the granitic peakb with snow on them are again seen, but of an inferior elevation. The village is rather large and like all those in Hangarang perfectly Tartar. The con- trast in appearance and language between this .race and the Kanhwaris,. was made more striking by the arrival of a man belonging to PGrbGnni in KanBwer, from Ladak, while we were here. He had come from Leh to Lari, a village two or three marches ahead, in fifteen days, and he informed- us that Runjeet Sinh had established a Wakil at Leh, and that the country. was considered subject to him, in the same manner as it had before been to ' Cashmir. The appearance of this Purgumah Hangarang, is mast strange and me- lancholy : mountains bare of forest, but above covered with a little snow, of the rounded form, with gentle declivities, but broken towards the river into abrupt and precipituus abysses ; in the beds of which where fed by a . stream, are seen a few trees, chiefly tbe osier, The rocks, though still a. good deal granitic, and felsyar common, yet are verging into clay slate of which there L much about this village ; above' Nakb, 'the ridge is of the trtie Himalaya form, rugged and precipitous, break* into pinnacles and crags,: but bare . .. even of the brown and scanty vegetatioa that in some pleaiure' $83.: COiJBSE AND tEVELS clothes tlle nakedness of these. A furious wind seems to reign here; i4 blows from about ten tgl three or four o'clock, when it lulls, but of its force it is difficult to give an idea ; in steadmesa 1 may compare it to the hot wind of the plains. A road wlis pointed out to us, which they said leade to Ghrti,; the distance a journey of twenty-two daye. The road is pawlle for horses, though not very goad. There k also a road henc~ to RGpeho, five day's journey, of about ei&amp;t or ni~e milee each, Prom Rlpsho, @fitah is twenty day's joarney, and Leh tPn ; tiam Skalkar represented to :be a few miles ahead, Lad is two day% journey, and Dadcar f~fi, eve.
