J. D. HERBERT; ~TH RPGT. N. I. IN 1819 in the caursa of the aurvey operations in which I wpa theq m-' gaged I traced the River Setlej to the confines of the British authorih. Having drawn up a short account of this journey awn af'r my return L have thought that imperfect as it is, it might be acc,eptabb to thp Society, The only apology I can o&amp;r for the meagre nature pf tlpis cornmynicatio~ (which isdeed is little more than a description of the road traveued) is t4s censtaat occupation which my duties as. Survey or gave me and the lqpg marches it was necessary to make on account of a deficiency of supplies. These two circumstances leftme little leiswe for obeervation OF enquiry, The Setlej has been lately known to derive ita source, if not from the lake Mtv&amp; <span class="loc">Hrad</span>, or the oeighbouring one of Mmsarovar, frew the high peund on which *ey are situated. From the source however, which by Capt. Hear- shj's map, is in-310 46. Lat. 800 45 Lmg. to <span class="loc">Ropur</span> in 30~ 58' and 700 81- a distrnee of upwards of 400 mdes, little was known concerning it, or the Qel 840 GQURSE AND LEVELS country it flows through, till the expulsion of the Gxlihas gave facilitie8 to research which had before been wanting : the exi~tence of a 4 ESTERN BRANCH of this great river beyond the smuy chain was not even suspected, and to our ignorance of this fact ma'y 'be attributed some errors which eould be pointed out in maps very recently published. Of the actual direction of its course an equal ignorance prevaiIed, or it could never have been made a question, wlaethr the BHAGIRATH~ bad its source.ecrithin, or beyond, the. snowy chain. We were equally ignomnt, of our proximity to the Chinese " dependencies ; to Ladhak and to <span class="loc">Tibet</span>'the .country of the Shawl goat ; and of the fact of a constant communication being kept up between these corn tries and the newly subjected mountain provinces, by a route penetrating through the hitherto reputed insuperable barrier of the <span class="loc">HIMALAYA</span>. These, with some other less'important particub-eatabfishd in this jonrney, are new to M&amp; Geographers, and as such may be not unworthy of record. The object of the tour was to explore and lay down as much of the course of this river as might be accessible. From the jedoaeg of the oUi- cers on the frontier, however, the anwey necessarily terminated at the limik bf our authority. At Shipki, the first village of Chinese Tartary, I  war^ cempelled to retrace my steps. From Roper to <span class="loc">Shipki</span> is about 230 miles, fhe whole line being throtigb a monntainoue coun-, at first easy of accesa and of inferior elevation, but afterward8 approaching the limit of perpetual eongelation and increasing in dficulties. The last 50 des, comprehend-. ing the Pergunnah of Kanauwer, is within the chain of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> and forms the route above alluded to. It is to this portion of-the wvey,L havs chiefly confined myself in the following narrative.

Gemd, of ,$be 8th Regiment, then doip.g.duty .with the Nasdrl l3attalion.of Gorkhaa. .We chose sr circuitous route for the purpos? of hyiog8op.en a part of the survey not then wisited. As little of interest however occurs in tbis early part of ourjourney, in which we passed througb the lower mountains, I shall be rather brief in my notice of it. Our route Jay in the4irsJ instpnce to the southward, crossing the Nagkunh pass, vated 0800 feet, This ridge seems to be composed of clay date passing into mica slate and quartz. It divides the supplies of the Setlej from thow of the Gii river, which falls into the Jumna. A few miles to the east of the pass, is the fort of Whartu, if two guard houses built of unhewn stoneq deserve the title of fort. It is elevated 10,000 feet above the sea, and i~ tberefore coasiderably colder than Kotgerh. The filbert, and the sycamore (the former producing excellent nuts) were found here. The ascent waa very steep, but there has been lately constructed an excellent road for horses, and a bungalow erected by Government, on the summit ofthe ridee, for the convenience of travellem. t , A fter,crossmg the pass, we proceeded down the Salar stream, a# feeder of &amp;e Giri, and crossed the latter, which is amongst the largest of the mom- tain rivers that have not their origin immediately from the snowy chain, We were now on the right bank of this river, and in the hill state of <span class="loc">Kyun</span>- thal. Hence our course lay 5. S. E. to <span class="loc">Cbepal</span> Fort in JGbal, crossing two of the principal feeders of the <span class="loc">Giri</span> and their separating ridges, and latterly 'the great back, of which the Chbr is the principal.peak, and which separates the river vallies of the,Giri and Tonse. This ridge is a ramifica- tion from the snowy chaia. It is ,of great height and steepness, and may be considered the principal ridge belonging to the valley of the Jumna. The + Chhr, the loftiest of its peaks, is elevated 12,140 feet above the level of the . sea. Many of the other peaks are not much less, and few of the passes north, of tbe Chb are under 9000 feet. It is well wooded.; though some of its peaks rise above the limit of forest. The juniper, a species of red current, the yp., yith the varietisl of pine except that.pec,uliar to the Hiqalay?,, 342 OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. 'tract, three apecies of oak, with a numerous list of alpine plants, are found 'here. The summit of the Ch6r is grey granite of a coarsegrain, which lowm 'down is exchanged for mica slate. On that part of the ridge which I cross. ed as above mentioned, I observed only granular qua~ta. - On the 12th, we reached Chepal, and hence our route took a turn to the Northward, crossing the Salwc river, (a feeder of the Tonse) and the high ridge which separates its sources from the valley of the PQber. We pass- ed through Deohra, the residence of the <span class="loc">Rana</span> of Jbbal, one of the smw dary mountain states. We crossed the PBber river under Raungerb, an inconsiderable fort, the water of which can be cut off, The passage of the P&amp;ber wl~ich is a large and rapid river, was effected on a hanging bridge of topes 123 feet long and 22 feet 'above the wate~. These bridges would seem to be on the same principle as our suspension chain bridges in <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Their swinging motion is very disagreeable, and generally gives the unpracticed passenger an idea of danger exceeding the r'eqlity. The tread is however a little unsafe, as the footway is quite open, jbst like a rope ladder, and some attention is required to avoid putting your hot through the opening instead of on the cross piece. The noise and fiam too of a mountain river, dashing beneath, are not much calculated to strengthen one's powers of attention. To a novice it is rather a disagreea- ble mode of crossing a rapid river, but a little practice reconciles it, like 41 . the other difficulties. ! @ere began our &amp;cent of the Changshel ridge, the . separating . ground of the PQber and Rtipin, both branches of the Tonse. and both large rivers. This ridge is a ramification from the snowy chain and is of great height. fk terminates above the confluence of the rivers, in rather aflat declivity, the lgss elevated partq of which are cultivated and well inhabited. The sidea df f hjs ridge aredeeply intersected with large torrents, and m the glens form+ 1 by are several substantial villages. Our path lay dong its nuq. WUlUl3 AND LEVELS 843 mi4 latterly above the limit of fore&amp;; our camp on the 24th. having attained an elevation of 11,280 feet. Here we found just below our tents, the juniper, and black and red currants ; the latter having a sweetish taste, The ther- mometer did not in the sun at noon rise higher than seventy-nine, and in the sbade only 670 6'. The folloming morning it was forty-one at day break. In proceeding along this ridge we attained an elevation of 13,000 feet. This part of the mountain was of course far above the zone of forest. It waa however clothed with a luxuriant pasturage, richly enamelled with a thou- sand flowers, many of which were familiar to us as the production of Eu-, rope. There was very little of rock visible; here and there a patch of quartz of a dazzling white, and mistaken at a distance for snow. As the ridge rose, the shattered tables of gneiss were seen to connect it with the granitic peaks of the snowy chain. Descending from this lofty ridge we, reached DGtlG on the Rtpin where we had ordered our supplies to be collected. The village is inconsiderable, and consists of but a few houses: It is chiefly remarkable as the residence of a petty marauder, who, before the establishment of the British authority, bad contrived to make himself feared by his neighbourn, on whom he levied contributions. From DGdG, , the route descended to the bed of tbe RGpin, which we crossed by ahga of thirty-five feet in length, ascending thence to <span class="loc">Kuara</span>, a substantial village of about forty houses. The river was deep and rapid, and the mountains of great height. On the 98th, we proceeded to <span class="loc">Jako</span>, the last village which we were to meet with on the southern face of the snowy range. The path was upon the whole difficult; our rate of progress being little more than a mile an hour. Two miles from PGjdi or <span class="loc">Kuara</span>, we crossed the RGpin once more on a <span class="loc">Sanga</span>, forty-four feet-iong, and eleven feet above the water. It seemed, .' even at this advanced point, a large river and the current very strong. Af- ter crossing, the aecent continues steep for about a mile, where the RGpin r receives another stream called the <span class="loc">Berar</span>, an equal body of water, if it be not, (as I thought) the greater. After this, there in a good deal of deacent, and, . . ' 344 ~OURSB AND ~EWEW then a level path along the river edge, to the hot sf the Tank61 deble, a very difficult and steep ascent to the village, by what might be called a na- tural flight of steps. The village is not large, and the inhabitants appear-. ed ill looking and dirty. They have little cdtivatiun, and depend cbiefig on what they earn as the medium of intercourse betuem the people of Ranauwer and Chuira, in the exchange which i% cohtinuallp made of their iespective commodities. The filbert was met with in great abundance to-day., Beyond Jako, we were informed, no villages would be met with, till we Pould reach the inhabited country on the other aide of the snowy range. ft was therefore desirable to cross the pass if practicable in this dayb barch. But it was found that the dificulties of the road, and the delay oc- casioned by the construction of a sanga, on which we crossed the RGpin hr the third time, did not permit such quick progress. The evening ww far advanced before we had reached the river head, and at3 we had now attained an elevation at which Are-wood ceases to be procurable, it became necessary to halt at this place, which hact also the, advantage of affording b degree of shelter to our followers in some ayes wd overhanging rocks. The first three miles being a descent to the river bed, was a9 extremely. bad path with a good deal of diilicult descent. <span class="loc">Uere</span> we were delayed by the construction of the sanga. The river mas rapid and wide, and though fordable, yet it was with dficulty, and only by the united efforts of three or four men in a knot, that the cnrrent could be ~temmed, The temp07 fature of the water was PO low as 43O and this added to the difficulty :I after a delay of nearly three houra, we were enabled to proceed. The path continues rugged. An ascent arduous at firat, afternards easier, leads along the river bank, while the bed or valley opens a little, +At &amp;be tbe mountains approach each other so as to form a gbrge, in which the ex- tieme narrowness of the opening; and the gigantic loftiness of the sidea are very striking. Some idea of the place may be formed from the elmah4 if thb dg6st overbanging crQ, taken from the bed of the her, and bw to be 720. Snow bde of eome extent were now met with, shewing we mere approaching the pass, and the fiequent occnrf6nce of the black and red' currant, with the birch, indicated an elevation very near the limit of forest, and consequently led ue to believe that the river head (judging from ana- legy) could not be far. We had nbw proceeded six miles and three quarters, uf which the last mile M two had ken in the river bed, and the path rather easier : an immense mass of frozen snod which appeared to have fallen into the river, and which was perfectly compact like rock, and not less than fif. ty feet thick, here excited. our attention : the etreim had undermined it, and forced for-itself a passage, bat the superincumbent mass was not the less firm or the mere likely ts give way : a little beyond this snow bed the path proceeds along a level piece of considerable width, agreeably shaded by birch trees ; while the surrounding mountain dasses, rising into turret- like peaks, with sides of a rnurd steepness, and bare, except where a.nari row ledge affords nourishment to a few hardy creepers or mosses, and the whole orowned with eternal snows, presented a picture, -*hch though naked and desolate, was by no means devoid of interest. <span class="loc">Henee</span>, the path is open, and presents few difficulties, occasionally leading over frozen ata- lanches, and along the river edge, which here spreads itself through this . little valley, meandering with a placid current over a sandy bed. Our ex- pectations- of accomplishing the passage of the mge, were strengthened a ' good deal byLour meeting bere a party from the village of <span class="loc">Durgaon</span>, on the A Tonse, who were returning with salt f'm KarnrG in hn6wer. They had crossed the pi156 about noon, and reported the old snow sdciently firm, - but the preceding day's fall, which was from two to three feet deep, was by no means so. The salt-was carried on sheep, which are, in the upper moun- tains, universally employed for this purpose ; each carries about five seers, and the load, being divided, is fastened on each side, to a little sadrdle or broad girth that passes round the body, and prevents its incumbering the animal or retarding its progress. Loaded in this manner they will, if the road [be good, make marches of ten milea a dar and keep, in good conditi- R r 346 -COURSE AND LEVZLS on, but then it is to be noted that the hill pasturage is excellent, and im- proves in luxuriapce the greater the elevation, . . short of perpetual snow. . . . . , .. . 7. :Towards .sunset we reached the limit of forest, .which,made its last ex- ,piring effort in the production of a few stunted,cre.epers of .the .Rbododew dron genus. The elevation of the place was 5 1,281 feet above thesea, which qay therefore be considered as the heigbt of this limit: several cares,'or overhanging ,rocks, capable of affording shelter to our followers; induced' us to Falt here, tlie evening being- far advanced and no firewood procurable aihead. . The night .was very cold, and in.the morning the thetmometer vas down to ,340 ; my companiop shot here a punql, which eorded us an .eqcellept dinner. . ., \ As we-had a-long and fatiguing march before us, we thought it advisable $to take some'refreshment before setting out.' Accordingly, it was near ten o'clock b efore we were firirly in motion. The narrow valley already des- cribed continues for a mile and a half further; the river broad but shallow, +-~~ing.litfle current. Fragments of every size, and of every kind of gra- nite or gneiss, were strewed about ; amongst them, some very brilliant, if not beautiful, specimens were abserved, in which the plates of mica were of an unusual size. The valley vas terminated by the ridge, apparently, of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> itself, -rising in front of us, from the face of which, the river ap- peared .to *issue in a noble cataract of two falls from 100 to 120 feet each. We ascended by a winding path to theIhead of these falls, which were sup- plied .by %he partial melting of the vat mass of snow that-filled the com- pass oflhe eye on whichever side it was directed. We were now at the \ imrilediate foot of this range, and all before us, to the very summit, was snbm. The first pa&amp; of our progress up this steep ascent, was -1ittIe im- pe4ed by&amp; ; it was scanty though soft. As we advanced, it increased in quantity thpngh not immediately in firmness ; the ascent continued steep, ,andatbe fatigue way much increased by.sinking. flere and &amp;re in thh .. . . , . 03r TRE RIVER SETLEJ'. immense.wilderne;ss, a turret-like peak was observed to bres k @e upvary ing; whiteness ,of the picture, its wall-like sides denying the snow to rest upoq , theml. thctlgh prese~itiug occasionally a ledge on which a few birds,that fitted about might alight.;:these turret-like masses gave a peculiar character to the scene. As re 'advanced nearer the summit of the pass, the assent be- came less severe, though the fatigue was still great, owing to the softness oE the snow, in which we rep.eated1i sunk up to the middle. - . . % day was nowafar advanced; though we had*proceeded but five miles ; a long and weary way. yet remained; and such was the exhaustion occasi- oned- by the, repeated sinkk in the snow, that it is probable me should not* have arrived in any reasonable. time,. but for a little refreshment which we had with us.

To add to our perplexity, the sky became overcast, black clouds collected overhead,$and at one time I even thought I felt a flake of snow, descend up-on my-outstretched hand - . . 3 ... , .. I A fa11 of snow, if at. allliehvjf, wodld'at this peribd of our progress, have. : .been the destruction of probably half our followers,, fatigued and dispirited ., ' as' they were, and .having We or six miles of snow -to surmount whether . the? went on or.tumed back. Fortnnatelp the alarm proved. a false~one; but the clouds continuing to.,collect and darken overhead, imdticed us to : use the utmost .expedition, that,. ig possible, we might reach the.other side of the pass before a change of weather should take.plaoe;. towards evening , . we discovered the summit rising in a wd'.of snow-to-.the height of about Rr2 I COURSE AND LEVEW 800 feet. ,To surmount this ascent required the most arduoas exertion, and we floundered about till nearly exhausted, in a soft acclivity of snow, lying at an angle of about 300. In time however, we reached the crest of &amp;e Gunhs Pass, extremely fhtigued, and not a little pleased in thinking we had so more +cent before us. A long and dreary may, .however, yet remained : as fa: as the eye could reach, a dismal expanse of spow met our view; the eun too was nearly set, and tbe temperature seqibly decreas~ng ; except my companion and myself, with one or two servants, none had yet reached the crest of the pass : most of the hill carriers bad indeed arrived at th~ foot of it, but there they stood with despairing countenances alike unwilling and unable to ascend the lofty scarp which still remained to be surmounted. A report, too, was brought us, that one of .them was taken ill,, and was unable to proceed. It became therefore necessary to gbandon .the baggage, as giving the only ,chance of our followers getting over their di@culties. before night fall. It was not Ivithout some trouble we could get them to understand this mea- sure, so that it was nearly dark before bhey w,ere fairly across. The moos rose, however, nearly full, an4 her.light, reflected from the expanse of snow, left little fear of aur mistaking nur way. The mow too was suficiently . hard to render the footing more lirm .than it had been in the former part of the journey, and being a desqnt the-whole way, there was no cause what- ever for apprehension or dismay ; the people were however not the less .alarmed, some 4at down and cried, others were prevented from lying down in the snow only by thr-, agd all, with ~.wy few exceptioas, looked frightened in no small degree. Tho,= who,gave least trouble were the ' Gorkha sepoys, and l&amp;~ssel,q~ap servantg, from the plaios.

On pro- mising a rupee for each load that should be recovered, the carriers set off in high spirits, and in the course of the day every thing was brought in. The day was fine, and we had an opportunity of looking about us and ad- miring the scene ; a scanty pasturage, .on which a few herds of yaks weie seen grazing, and some bushes of the dog briar, were all that we saw in the shape of vegetation. The place we were encamped on, called  nun^ <span class="loc">Bassa</span>, is on the left bank of a stream which has its rise in the snows of the . pass we had just crossed ; it runs about north, or little east of north, to join the <span class="loc">Baspa</span> nearly opposite Sangla. Above or around us, nothing was seen but huge peaks capped with snow, the lower limit of which was not many feet above our camp. Although the elevation did not much exceed 13,000 feet, so great was the cold even at this season of the year,. that all the streams were frozen, and during the evening a heavy fall of snow came. 350 COURSE AND LEVELS on, and gave us an opportunity of congratulating each. bther that we hd rid deferred the passage of.the range. This snow storm interrupted a hip we. 1 had contemplated making to revisit the pass, and which we put into ere+' cution the following morning. We found the distanceaboutfour miles and% half, which occupied ue three hours, being continued ascent wd #atha steep latterly. . , . .1 Undisturbed by anxiety, we now found ourselves with sufficient le'rsnre ta observe and to enjoy this singular scene. Seated on this primeval ridge, which. at a distance had been so often the subject of admiration and wonder, it still; seemed a matter of surprize to us how we had reached such a spot. Around, us, and rising from the platform on which we stood, were seea many of:: . tbose peaks wbieh form such conspicuous objects from the plains: though elevated nearly. 16,000 feet above the sea, we still looked up to the stu- . pendons structures before whose superior height the <span class="loc">Andes</span> themselves sink , into inferiority. Their nearness and consequent great apparent magnitude, the idea that we were now close to objects so often viewed from great dis- tances, and which had so often exercised conjecture ; these and a thousand other circumstances gave an interest to the scene, that it is difficult to corn- ' municate by any description. On every side avast expanse of snow met the view, the eternal abode of wintry horrors, where the animal and vegetable creation are alike oppressed, and nothing is seen but barrenness and deso- lation; conjecture is lost in attempting to fix the extent, the depth, or the duration of these snows, which belong to a chain at once the highest and the most extensive in the world. As viewed from this spot, the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> is far from being a regular ridge, ' or single series of peaks; they are seen in every direction, rising up from amidst the wilderness of snow that extends many 'miles in breadth. Look- ' ing to the north, the eye traces the stream, on the banlis of which our camp lay, to its junction with the <span class="loc">Baspa</span>, not that the actual waters of either are ' seen, for they lie far too low for the eye to detect them, but the general run and junction of the two vallies is distinguishable. Beyond the <span class="loc">Baspa</span>, &amp;&amp;in, appear peaki still higher than those of the ridge hn which we stood, &amp;om which it seemed as if the range here took a turn, the Basps coming horn the salient angle, and being shut in by an external or doubie ridge tb the southward. ' It has been thought by some, that the northern ridge is disiinguished by the name of <span class="loc">Kailas</span>, while the southern retains that of ~i: malaya, but 1 have not myself observed any distinction of this kind, made by the mountaineenr. It has rather appeared to me, that they, as  be^ the -people of the plains, call every high place by the term <span class="loc">Kailas</span>,' aid ap- ply it equally to the southern asto the northern ridge. .The snow on the pass we found perfectly hard; and having a most beaa- tiful crystallized surface. This peculiarity of appearance 1 liave almost afkays observed in snow that is situated abovb the limit of congelation. We endeavoured to guess at its depth, by sounding with our longest sticks', bat, though assisted by the whole length of the arm up to the shoultier, we could not touch ground. Indeed as it is hardly to be eupyosed that .this snow melts jn any quantity to be compared with what'falls annually, it-must be considered as the accumulation of ages. It 3s evident, notwith- I standing the elevation, that a small quantity does melt, for a t'hermometer ' hung dose to the surface of the snow, the sun sbi~ing on it, rose above 600 : atiii the yearly supplies must greatly exceed the waste, so that we may, without hazarding an error,'well suppose it on the increase., The thermo- meter in the shade was 370. Towards noon we returned to Camp, and fie following morning quitted this' inhospitable (pot.

The fields were divided and makked out by what are called stone hedges, and there were. small huts flat-roofed for the accommodation of those who had to watch or cut the grain, the village itself (<span class="loc">Sangla</span>) being still at a considerable dis- tance. Six miles and a half from our camp, we emerged from the forest, where a scene, beautiful and picturesque in a high degree, presented itself to our view, a broad and rather swift river watered a fertile and green val- ley of qonsiderable width. On this side, were seen immense forests do- to the very edge of the water ; on that, the more open and well conhsted appearaace of successive table lands rising from ke river bed, cultivated, and their borders shaded by poplars and willows, while in the middle of two of the largest, the eye rested on two substantial villages, containing each npt leas than eighty houses ; below, every thing was green and smiling, but as the eye rose, it once more encountered the black and nake'd racks, and, still higher, the eternal snows of the frost bound Himalaya. we arossed the <span class="loc">Baspa</span>, the river above noticed, on a well,boarded, and railed sanga , . ninety-one feet in length, and took up our quarters in the nearer of the two villages, Sangla. The distance was seven miles and three-quarters, the +hole a considerable, though not steep, descent. We were now in Kanbwer, a purgunnah of the mountain state Biseahir. Previously to entering into any detail of our journey over t11,is newground, , 1 it'may be proper to throw, together a few particulars, which though the re- sult . of .. the journey, and consequently not in order here, strictly speakin&amp;, mdy .. yet rdnder what follows more intelligible. *KanBwer comprehends the valley of the Setlej aud ita principal feeders, frond lat. 310 33; long. 770 47'; to lat. 310 51; long. 780 422 on the north ad r. cast it is contern~inous with the Chinese.possessions, and on the west wit11 'the Tartar p~zrgunnah of Hangareng, also subject to Bissahir, with Ladak, l and with KGllG, a mountain state situate on the right bank of the Setlej, "and now subject to Runjeet Sinh. It may be said to be entirely within the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> range, though extending from north to south forty-three miles; for, on the south, it has tlie ridge that had been crossed, the peaks of which have an elevation of from 19 to 2 1,000 feet, ~~T-i~iie to the north of it is seen , , 'the Purkyul ritlge, tlie highest peak of which is near 22,000 feet high. The 'villages are not numerous, but tbey are some of them more substantial than .are generally seen in the mountains. KBnam and Sungnam are two of the largest, and contain about a hundred families . . each. The houses are built of Bewn stone, with occasional layers of the Deodar pine, which at the corners ' are fastened with wooden keys. The roofs in the lower part of Kanawer are sloping, and formed of shingles ; in the upper part, where violent winds prevail, they are flat and covered with earth; the former are generally two , btories liigh, sonletimes three ad even four, with a balcony on one or two sides, in the latter they are seldom more than one. Still farther north of it is tari, in Ladak ; the houses are built of unburnt bricks; the climate being ' such that little rain or even snow ever f'ctlls.. . t .Some of the villages are situated in the immediate valley of the river; many in the glens watered by the large feeders which derive their sup- plies from the snows of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span>; their elevation is generally from 8 to MOO feet, though some are much below and others much above this ,esti- mate. The soil appears to be totally diBerent from that of the southern mountain provinces. The grape cannot be naturalized by any eflorts or any care out of Kan6wer '(within the mountains I mean;) the Neozir pine, the seeds of which are excellent and form a valuable article of export, is not . to be found beyond the limits of this tract. The turnip too attains a per- fection in KanAwer which it' wants elsewhere ; and the apples are alone . those, within the circuit of the mountains, worthy of a comparison with tbe -. . 8 a 554 COURSE AND LEVELS s,une fruit in England. Of grains they have the usual varieties, most of wllich are mentioned by hfr. Moorcroft. Wheat, barley, chenna, paphro, . ora ; of these the latter is valuable for its hardiness, flourishing in climates where no other grain will live. Barley is fouucl at great elevations ah Qf wheat they do not appear to hale much. The people of Kanfitver are tall and rather handsome, with expressive countenances ; they are not, however, so fair as I shoulcl have expected to find them in so cold a climate. Their manners are good'; they am open , and communicative without being deficient in respect. They are almost all  trader^, and consequently great travellers, visiting <span class="loc">Leh</span>, <span class="loc">Garii</span>, and the othet marts, chiefly for salt an3 wool. Their export. are grain, much of which they receive from the lower mountains, raisins, neozas, iron, and broad .cloth, which they obtain at Kotgerh, kc. They possess a degree of wealth and consequence wldch no other mountain tribe has attained to ; their lan- guage is essentially different from that of the Tartars, and has even no afii- nity with the other mountain dialects ; whether it be related to any of tlle dialects of the south is a pint on which 1 am unable to offer any opinion. The Rocks of Kanriwer are those of the mowy chain : a large river like the Setlej, penetrating throng11 this chain and- wit11 its numerous feeders laying bare the order and varieties of its parts, ant1 displaying so clearly ihcir structure, offers a field for re.;earch whicl~ promises to repay sniGeo- logist who shall devote his exclusive attention to it. My duty as Surveyor - left me little time for attending to these matter&lt;, even if my acquaintance with the subject llad fitted me for ttre enquiry. Such obvious apibearances as - inust strike the most unobserving I may mention. On the pass \re had c!oss- , ed, the only rock is a blackish gneiss of a fine grain, and i~nperfectly lami- - nAted. In the bed of the <span class="loc">Baspa</span>, rolled pieces of granite of cvery variety ore . ,. to be met with; and in thejourney upwards, granite occurs freq~~ently, as - ;dso gneiss, quartz, and clay and mica slate. At ifiurnng the gratlitc is ex- , dmngcd for clay slate, which continues for a considerable distance, and to a g~e:~t elckatioa (13,000.) In the bed of the river \\.here tlris change takes place, mica slate of a dark brown colol* and horny structure is met with 1% large iklnsses, and quartz also, both semi-crystallized and perfectly so. The clay slate, ~vliich continnes from <span class="loc">Murang</span> through varying levels, is ex- . changed for gl-mite again at Dabling, and this further on, for a very fine grained and imperfectly marked gneiss of a 1)lueish grey colour. To tile -north of Sl~ipki and in the Tixrtar ptlrgunilah of Hangnrnng, the mountains are of a rounded farm and apparently compoied of clay slate. The speci- mens wllich I have the honor to lay before the Society, may perhaps enable some Mineralogist to give a more correct and detailed account of this matter. Kani\ver is divided into several Purgunnahs, but they are,tao minute to be worth particularizing. The upper part is divided into two, <span class="loc">Siia</span> and TGkba, the latter of which is again subdivided into upper and lower. <span class="loc">Sua</span> or <span class="loc">Sijang</span>, extends along the right bank of the Setlej, and Thkba along the left, that is the upper TGkba ; the lower comprehends the vdey of the <span class="loc">Basya</span>, and contains the following villages : KamrG or <span class="loc">Mohni</span>, about - - - - - 70 or 80 Houses.

There is a pass beyond Cliil- kul, to Nilang, on the JBranbbi, (a place I, visited in August, 1818,) by a route .leading u/) the river bed. A man of the Cllilkul village, was .' ' pointed out to me who had traversed tl~iv pass, he described it as present- .. in$ a series of diilicultiea of the worst kind. Be travelled four days (from ' . - ... 8 s ... 356 COURSE AND LEVELS Chilkul) before he reached the head of the river, then* ascending the pass he had three day's snow, and lastly two of descent .to MGkba on the Bhagirathi; fmm Mhkba to Nilang, his route coincided with mine. Nilang.- they also call Chbngsa, which they say is the Tartar name. Salt is in these mountains the great incentive to discovery ; it is the want of this necessary that induces them to undertake journies of peat length . and privation, and it is in search of it, and with the view of shortening as much as possible the route, or of obtaining it cheaper, that these people ~o~tinually attempt what may be called voyages of discovery. From Ni- lang they could of course obtain it, did not the difficulties of the road pre- sent obstacles in the way 0f.a frequent communication, besides which the ~eople of that village charge more than those of others. At present this part of Kanawer receives ita salt from the Tartar villages of <span class="loc">Stang</span> and . <span class="loc">Bekaf</span>, situated on the Setlej, below Chaprang. There are two routes to . thqe villages, the one by Shipki is long but presenting no extraordinary .. ' difficulties, and having a succession of villages the whole way ; the other is a shorter route, but the ditliculties are said to be very great. In this case they go up but half-way toyards Sbipki, and strike off towards the right or east, leaving the hed of tbe Setlej, and crossing the main of the Hi- malaya they descend . . on the other side again into its bed. Cbtiprang is re- presented to be . but , six days journey (fp 1oaded.sheep.) from Sbipki ; from Nilang they represent: it but. eight,; the nature of the road from Nilang to C hhprang they describe as excellent, and passable for horses the whole way. A few miles below <span class="loc">Sangla</span>, the <span class="loc">Baspa</span> river joins. the Setlej. Oor route crossed the high ridge, which runs down as a ramification from the snowy chin towards the point of confluence.

Along the whole line of path which gradually ascends to the limit of snow, about J'4 or 15,000 feet you look dm upon the <span class="loc">Baspa</span>, a fearful depth below. The whole of this part of the distance is extremely fatiguing, the path occasionally bad, and not seldom dangerous. , HBrang ki Ghhti is the name of the highest peint ; it is the cornec crest of the range rising above the confluend of the <span class="loc">Baspa</span> and Setlej. - From thence the descent is eisy through a pleasant forest of pines, amongst which 1 observed a species new 6 me producing a cone, the seeds of wbich form an article of export, being - '- . eaten as almonds ; they are called Neozas.

Near <span class="loc">Raba</span>, .we found the rocks felspar, which in many places was in a state of decom- yosition ; in general, aqd where not otherwiqe ~oticed, granite and gneiss .are the prevailing rocks. We found here, as usual., excellent grapes, and the $ops of the houses were :s,vered with them spread out to dry fqr exportati- .on. The vineyards were ,very extensive, and ,their produce very fine and luxuriant. During the evening.much rain fell and tlienight was cloudy, but +here was ng snow, although the elevation was 7540 fe@.

Beyond Rispa it continues high dove tbe river bed, bui presenting no difficulties, except the ateep and,alrnost perpendicular descent to the Tedang river, which here joins the Setlej, and .which is shut in by mountains of gqeqt magnitude and wall-like steepness. We crossed it on .a sanga immediately above its confluence.

We could have been. well contented -to have taken a day's rest in so agreeable a spot; and besides this object, we. should have been well pleased to have cultivated a closer acquaintance with our friend the Lama, who seemed both intelligent and communicative. We had however no choice, and at ten o'clock quitted <span class="loc">Murang</span>. We left <span class="loc">Murang</span> at ten o'clock : the flrat two miles is a steep ascent up thd mountain on the declivity of which it is situated, On reaching the crest' af the ridge, we met traders belonging to the village returning from Mgtjan, a <span class="loc">district of Mahh Chin</span>,* with eighty goat, sheep, and ass loads of by-' angi wool. They had a small shawl goat also with them, and we obser~ed both in this animal and a kid of the same breed (which we had received, ih a present at <span class="loc">Puari</span>) the shawl wool proper lying under its outer and usual coat of hair: a dog too, of Tartar breed, accompanied them, in size and appearance a good deal resembling a Newfoundland dog. They had been three months absent, and seven of their sheep had died on the road,, a duty of two pice per load was collected from them at <span class="loc">Ritang</span>, where a Chinese Sirdar resides. We had a long journey before us, and were not a little sorry we could not stop to have some conversation with them ; but, it was now near noon, and we were obliged to push on. We met with the gooseberry here in great plenty, though small and acid, a male yak,t kept - for breeding, was seen grazing here.

A little more ascent brought us to the summit of the Childing Kona Pass ; here we had an extensive view of the range, and some of the highest peaks appeared sufficiently near : to the north they were of less elevation, and some ranges were distinguished quite bare of snow. No forest however was seen, apd their form or outline was rounded, without any of the sharp and shattered peaks of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> granite. The elevation of the pass is abopt $2,388 feet above the sea. The ascent still continued ; the path , leading through rocky defiles, or along the face of clay-slate accliritieu, in . which the fragments that formed the footing had all the looseness and mobi- . ljty of ashea. The last ascent was a flight of steps, cut in the rock to the . summit of the <span class="loc">Kherang</span> pass, which judging by the depression ofthe one - left behind (150) must be about 1500 feet higher. This estimation of its ele- . vation receive8 sQWtb from the fact of our finding snow on it, and for se- * veral hundred feet down, on the northern hce. Hence to Nissang, the de- - scent yas continued and steep, but the ascent had been so gevere and the path so bad, that it was already late, and ve did not arrive at the village ti]) near seven o'c)ock, our followers all behind, and neither tent nor suy- plies up. We were so fatigued that we had little appetite, and, contenting . ourselves with such fare as the village afforded, were glad to lie down and get sow re@. The whole distaqce wqp eleven miles, Nissang is inhabited by sixteen Lamas. It is a poor and inconsiderable village, situated in a most bleak, barren, and desolate spot. It is on the - left bank of a stream, up tbe bed of which is a route to Btang and Beker, two villagee on the Setlej, where these people frequently go for salt. The difficulties of the road are great, and the cold suffered, in passing a hi&amp; ridge covered with snaw, intense. The next village, called Dabling, was represented to be at so great a distancq Ttl 864 COURSE .AND LEVELS a-head that it mould be necessary to divide it into two stages, in which. case we should be obliged to encamp halfdway, and would require pro- visions for one day with us. Having made our arrangeme:~ts we left <span class="loc">Nis</span>- sang at a qnarter to seven, ad. stopped! to breakfast at a quarter to nine, at the last piece of water we vere to meet for many miles. The descent- from the village to the Tala Khir Nullah is steep but short. The ascent. appeared at first d@cult, if n~t impossible, on account of the seeming bare- ness and eteepness of the rqo~ntain side. We. however proceeded, climb- iqg slowlr up an wlivity of Loose hgmenfs, which latterly appeared to deviate more from the perpendicular, retising from the face of the range, between high and prohctieg wdh or chedrs that ruse up on each side in threatening array. $very bundned yw&amp; we wers compelled to take breath, andJ we did not reach the Geri PGg Pass till noon, a distance of five miles fqxq Nipsang, As. the path ascended, it retired, and became less steep, apd latterly we saw some appearance of forest, particularly aeveral species of juqiper in, full fruit* U was in fact the projecting crage I have already noticed that, concealing the route, had given us so exaggerated an idea OF the difficnltiw ; they were however still great ; the meat may be judged of7 by the deprpsion of Nissang (r2B0), and the elevation of the pass appeared by the theodolite to be the. same as the <span class="loc">Kherang</span> Pass, crossed the preced- day, The path beyond this became frightfully bad, and.frequently made me.. pause, familiar as 1 was with the diaticulties of mountain roads. The loose fragments of every size,. accumulated against tbe declivity of hard and bare clay slate mountains over vv:hi,ch our track lay, eqnally threatened us frotp above and from below., Such was their mobility, that tile wind was sufficient to detach ,them, and once set ip motion, evenone stone however small, was sufficient to bring d~ws .volliey upon w.

These difficulties continued for about a mile, after which we were much relieved to find matters improve, for a short dis- t-mce. *he descent however gradually increased in steepness, leading <span class="loc">Jowa</span> the left bank of the Tomba glen, in which we had new difficultia and dangers to contend with. To have a correct idea of these places it must be borne in mind, that at this time we were proceeding along the'de- elivity of the great snowy range : so lofty a range, it may be'mpposed, can- not rise hm, so low a level as the river has here, with the undeviating recl gularity comprehended in the terms slope or declivity; on the contrary it is necessary to view the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> mountains themselves, those eldest horn of creation, to estimate even approximately the gigantic scale on which the furrows or cavines fofthed by the numerous torrents that spring from their snows, intersect their sides.

From the lateral ridge, where the immediate descent commences, to the stream, ie a distance of two mi1e.s~ and a quapter, of this a mile .and a half l~fesents no very great. difliculties though the path is bad enough, but the last three quarters ofa mile baffle description : at the first glance it seems impossible ever to teach tho bottom, such is the steepness of this precipice, for it can be called nothing else; a winding path however, requiring the utmost caution in traversing it,- ie at.lengthdiscovered,'and you go down a hard dry and steep terrace, sprinli- led as it were with loose ftagments- of clay slate of every size. To avoid moving, tbeae is impossible; to chelter .one's self is equally so, and the only alternative for the ,peu&gt;ple ww to. go m- knots, with considerable intervals and get over it as quick as possible. The cmmblg and Ioose nature 06 . the little gravel tbat covers it with the hardness of the snbsoil, makes this as dangerous as the .other, for one false step or slip would precipi- tate one to the bottom. The last piece leads along the edge of a naked and steep precipice, the path bei~g extremely narrow, and strewed as abve described with a hard dry gravel. We got safe down however, al- th~ugh we bad even then little cause for congratulation, for in the bed of the stream it was imposoible ts think of remaining. The cave in which the Mu- rang people had the last year sheltered themselves, had disappeared, and in- stead of it we beheld the fragments of fallen peaks, the ruinous proofs of the vast power of the avalanche. The whole appearance of the place or ground, was insecure : to lpok up t~wprds the head of the glen gave no confidence, for there you saw similar muses prepared for a similar de- scent. To ascend the ather bank was then our only alternative, and oar determination was bastened by the threatening appearance of the weather; a lowering gloom bemn t~ envelope the summits of the surrounding peaks, dark clouds col!ected, and every symptom was discoverable of an approach- ing fall of snow. We therefore quickly ~ade our determination, and corn- menced a climb of about a quarter of a mile in which our hands and feet were equally employed. The path the* got a little better, and we Roan came to a more open place, +ere we thought there was less danger of b&amp; ipg; overtaken by falling peaks. Tbe whole distance was twelve miles and a quarter, and we arrived at half past five, having quitted Nissang a little before seven. We had been very nearly ten hours on the road, and eight hours on foot, during which timg we asce~ded and descended not less thq 7,009 feet* Our troubles were not yet at an end ; may of OUE people were behind ; it was fast getting dark, and we dreaded, lest not knowing the nature of the road, they should attenlpt to descend to the bottom of the glen, iq nbicb case their destruction we knew was inevitable : all night long a con- $hued shouting was kept up oqe side of the glen tp the other, which OF TEE RIVER SfiLEJ. 867 timing by inteivals and in such a scene, had a singular effect.

Theraometer at 4b a temperature indicating considerable elevation.' We set out a little befofe seven, but, in consequence of the fatiguing march- es of the two preceding days, did not deem it advisable to proceed more' than six miles and a half, to Hopeha Wodar, a halting place (no'village,) on the' banks of a stream. Notwithstanding the early hour at which we set out and the eompamtive' sbortnees of the stage we did not sit down to' breakfast till 1 p. rn. The path was in general good, and part of it was ex- cellent and passable for horses : I must except, however, the immediate descent to the bed of the stream where we encamped, which was almost' equal to any thing we had yet seen in danger and di5culty. There was liot hokever much of it. We found it very cold during the day, and a hi&amp; ' wind served to render it still more uncomfortable. The appearance of the place was bleak, barren, and desolate. To Dabling, we found a distance of seven miles and aqu*ter, so that the' whole route from Nissang to Dabling, in which no village or habitatiorl is met with, was twenty-six miles.' ~hese miles it is to be recollected are ' however estimated in rather a rough manner, and therefore I lay no great stress on this' value of the distance ; it is certain that it is not less than : twenty. This path presents no di5culties but there is some steep ascent : and descent. We observed granite in this march' occupy the place of'. the clay slate which we have had frorn7M"rang, 1 may say. We passed' the 'Pose or Namptn .sanga, a well constructed wooden bridge with rail- ingsover tbe Setlejat Pose. The river has the appearance of having been obstructed by a barrier of rock*, through which it fork&amp; foi itself a . . *sage: on these rocks, which still narrow the stream, the britlge:rests.

The hedrmaa, a Lama, came to pay his reepecta to us in a dress exactly similar to what is represented as the Chinese costume, his stockings were of woollen atu&amp; sewed, and ought rather from their shape, or pant of shape, to have beea ded bags; his sboea were exactly Chinese, the soles having a spherical d~ape. He wore also Q Chihese skull cap, but the other people in the vil- lqe went bareheadad, and wore long taile plaited. They were all rather fair, particularly the women who had s fine rosy colour.

COURSE AND  LEVEL^ most curious and novel appearance, (at lea&amp; to me :) they lete twisted and waved, and apprirently lifted up in diffreent directions : beyond this spot, 'we observed the river for nearly half a mile collected as in a great lake ; the surface smooth enough to reflect the snrroanding mountains as in a mirror: it then precipitates itself dowh a step of rocks with all the foard and impetuosity of a cataract ; the fall is however not great, perhaps about :three or four feet. The river bed is of a moderate wldth, and here and there remains a level strand, of fifty to a hundred yards, along which the patb lies. In this level piece, we observed frequent cumuli, or heaps of stones ; they were built with some care, their length was various, their widtb about three or four feet, and their height the same ; on the tap were thrownloose- ' ly a number of stones covered with inscriptions, or rather, I should say, with one inscription, for on examining and comparing them, it was perceived that -they were all repetitions of the mysterious expression noticed by Captaia Turner, Om maw nee put men hoong. The letters were m relief d ere* cuted with considerable neatness. \ Seven miles and a qdarter fiom Dablihg, we came to the conflh&amp;c&amp; Uf a river of nearly equal size with the Setlej, but could not learn its proper name. The people called it <span class="loc">Spiti</span> Maksang. <span class="loc">Spiti</span> being the name of the Purgunnah it flows through, and Maksang signifying a river: the left branch, which is the largest, retains the name of <span class="loc">Lang</span> <span class="loc">Jing</span> <span class="loc">Kampa</span>, and is the proper SETLEJ. The <span class="loc">Spiti</span> appeared to flow here between two Iofty walls of rock, and of great steepness : a shall hamlet called <span class="loc">Kap</span>, of two houses, overlooks the confluence, and this is the highest place where the grape grows. There are .no grapes at Dabling, but Dabling is considerably elevated above the river, though at <span class="loc">Poi</span>' which is in the bed of the river, there are : the ,.;rapes df <span class="loc">Kap</span> are scarcely worth cultivating; they do not ripen properly, and are little better than the produce of the wild vine which is fouhd in the low&amp; ' part of Kanftwer. . i . - - - 1 <span class="loc">Namja</span> is a village of about tsde;ty houses. It is situated in a most bleak, OP'THE RIVER SETLEJ.) 391 brren, and desolate spot; a few fields of corn and some apricot hees are a11 that shew the vicinity is that of a village; the houses are, as always described, $at roofed, being covered with earth. From <span class="loc">Murang</span>, we had heard nothing but the Tartar language ; here it was in perfection, yet strange to say, the Se- yana or head-man's name was Baliram. In appearance he was a complete Tartar, and though .it is true he spoke Hindustani (for he acted as our in- terpreter,) yet it was most barbarously, and with a peculiar accent. He had been a great traveller, and we found him very communicative ; we deter- mined, as he was the only person we could find capable of acttng as an in- terpreter, to make him accompany us lo <span class="loc">Shipki</span> ; he told us that they trade with <span class="loc">Shipki</span>, <span class="loc">Meyang</span> and Chiprang, for salt and wool ; that Chbprnng is nine days journey from Shipki and Mansarowar twenty ; on horseback, however, the former journey is performed in four or five days, and the latter io twelve. <span class="loc">Meyang</span> is two day8 journey from Shipki, the Setlej'being left to the right; few mountains about it, and a little beyond it is plain countryi The country beyond Shipki is called,' by the Kantiwaris, Jbng, by the Tar. t,are, Galdang Paprang ; beyond it is Kiunling, and then Gehna. <span class="loc">Latsa</span> is the residence of two otficers of the Emperor of <span class="loc">China</span>, who re- aeive the revenue ; none of which goes to the grand Lama at Teshh Lorn- bG ; .he is rather a 'priest .than a raja or ruler, but in the former character .he has great inflaence.

I say dance rather than nach, for to the latter it Lad not the 'slightest resemblance. ' On this occasion, the performers were all women, . , -bui the munshi 'who accompanied ng, and who, had before visited the place, =%dd ns the men frequently bore their part. They stood in a semicircle on one side of the room joining hands, and all singing in chorus, and kept ti&amp; $0 their song, by swinging from one side to the other with one accord; there ?. . .

This was however pronounced by the munshi, to be a very tame exhibition tci that in which both men and women joined; but as we had no opportunity of witnessing tbis kind of dance, our account of it would be but imperfect. On this and other occasions, we noticed the Tartar wotnen to be much hirer than any we had before seen. They had also rosy complexions that might emulate those of <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and their countenances, though possessing all the pecw liar features of that race, yet exhibited a variety of character and expression which is not to be seen in Hiddustan, The women sf the lower mountains possess it also, but in a less degree, no doubt owing to the mixture of Tw- tar blood. ' From <span class="loc">Namja</span>, our next stage was Shipki, which we ktrred would be th$ limit to our travels in this quarter, although at Dabliq and at Namj~ we were strongly assured that orders had been received to conduct us to Ghu; The road to <span class="loc">Shipki</span> was tolerably good, with the exception of one vbry steep and deep descent through a narrow defile, huge rocks, like buttresses or tow- ers, overhanging the path. It is called Lakongrna, and is immediately ab;ove a stream called HGpsang Ttikbo, where travellers generally halt for refrebh- ment ; beyond this the ascent is severe, aid continued as far as <span class="loc">Shipki La</span>, the highest part of the route. Here we hada view up tbe valley of the Setlej (which suddenly widens) for fifteen or twerlty miles, the colirse from the eastward. No sharp granite peaks were to be seen in that direction, but bare round clay slate mountains, with here and there a slij~bt tack of snow ; no forest in any direction. From this point, the frost north- the Setlej attains, the river bends off on each side. To the mrth en the right bank rises up a cluster of snowy peaks, the highest of which is oalled Phk- yG1; its elevation must be upwards ofZ1,000 feet. The dement to the V&amp; lage is easy; the whole distance from <span class="loc">Namja</span> is he deo. . - On om mival, we found the p+e assembled to receive u6 ; they fo-4 OE-' THE $~#~~~-sIT~XJ%J. 8%3 father a motley @dupe; some were bare-headed, some wore caps with flat crovtns ornamented with fringe ; some had tails which were plaited and de- wended to their be el^ ; others had their hair close cut; some were dressed . m the skiri af the dh%*f goat, the wool inside ; others had a coat of red wool- Im stuff, which they say is mnefactured in the interior ; almost all wore, what seetned to as, breeches and stockings ; the latter it id true were more Eke bags. Their shoes were quite Chinese-like, those already noticed at Dabling with roilrid soles, such an to us appeared to be a matter of no little skill to walk in. In the girdle we observed stuck a double flageolet, on which they play, but it may be supposed very rudely. A steel tobacco pipe, a bunch of kegs of curious fashion, and a steel set in brass to light their pipe.

The most remarkable feature about thbm was their excessive filth, to which we had seen nothing equal.

Ih this direct tion the view was open for fifteen or twenty miles, to wbich distance.the, Setlej was visible. No villages however " embosomed soft in trees," were there ; no forests, not even a bush, broke the uniformity of the bare and brown acclivity which rose from the wqter's edge to heights of 18 and 19,000 feet. To the nort4 was the high peak PGrky61, belonging to the ridge which separates the two branches of the $etlej. Here all was rock, bare ard steep precipices, with very little snow. This high ground, as far as we could judge, continued up to the north, so that we saw it endwise, and consequently only one ar two peaks belonging to it. The village, con- sisting of six scattered hamlets, is spread out on the flat declivity of the L first noticed ridge, which, from the top to the very bottom, appears to be but one uniform scene of rocky barrenness, except where the indystry of 'these people has fixed a few hardy productions, and, with not a little labor, brought some level patches into cultivation, A hedge of gooseberry bush- es sqrrounded the fields in which we were encamped. G row of willow4 or ozjers, wbich in the day afforded shade to our followers, were the only trees. In front of our tents ran a clear and rapid rivulet, at which might be seen drinking the bushy-tailed yak; at our door lay agock of Tartar sheep, unrivalled fpr size and beauty as for fioeness of wool. pe shawl goat al- so was there, and the Tartar dog, having like the goat a fj~e wool under hip coat of hair. The picture was completed by an assemblage of Hindustania, kanqwaris, and Tartars, seated in groups ; the contrast of whose dresse~ 3 JV&amp; scarcely less strikipg than that of their features and of their speech.

Adverting to the rounded form aad inferior elevation of the mountains to the eastward, I thought it extremely likely that by ascending the snowyb ridge to the S. W. I might be able to catch a distant view of the <span class="loc">Table Land</span>, and even succeed in observing it8 depression which would fix, with- in certain limits, this so much disputed level : the ascent was very steep towards the top ; littie snow lay on it where 1 ascended, but to the south- ward it rose considerably and there tbe snow covered it. In my ascent I disti~rbed numberless covies ef Chacors, and even some Munals or golden Pheasants. Tb ascent occupied me fonr hours, and'fatigued' as I was, I rushed 11p the last hundred paces, thinking to see the promised land, but I was disappointed.

Shipki produces wheat, barley, and the grain called Gd, which to me ap- peare a speck8 of barley, likewise chenna, bu&amp; no other grain of the molln- Qbg.

On the Zlst we returned to <span class="loc">Namja</span>, and thdfbllowing day crossed. the: $31eji and. encamped at <span class="loc">Tashigang</span>, a small hamlet on the declivity of the y(lrkyG1 ridge ; one mile of descent brought .us to the river bed, where we: qr.wsed- on. a very good jhhla or bridge of ropem, which me constructed of) twigs of ozier on dow ; it was ninety-nine feet in le*, and thirty feeti above the water. The river was here obstructed by large rocks, eome of: vhicb were curiously honey-combed, and had many deep poolti, in them ; it! was&amp; fordable. The ascent was most steep, and continued for tbree.mi1-c qud a half from the river bed ; the difference. of level being about 3500feet. we found the gooseberry here in great perfection, with.smeral na~ fruitr,;; the elevation I suppose to be 10,177 feet The snowy peak PGrkyGl is seen to.wering high above the village, ita elevation 24'. The appearance of the mountain side at.a distance, is that of a bare and precipitous waste ;. but on reaching it, we fourid a good deal of even ground ; some fine pasturage. as well as cultivation, and several ponies of a. good appearance grazing about. <span class="loc">Tashigang</span> is in TGkba, and consequently in Kaniiwer. There is a small temple built at the expew of the grand Lama. We arrived about eleven o'clock, and as we had still Baliram, the <span class="loc">Syana</span> of <span class="loc">Namja</span>, with us, 1 made him give some account of the course and origin of the right branch of the Setlej. Beyond Skalkar, he said, whither we were now proceeding, was still another village belonging to Bissahir, called 8Gmra. SGmra is on the <span class="loc">Spiti</span> river, and from SGmra to Larl, the first vil- lage of Ladak, is a short march; beyond hi, about one or two and a half miles, he represented we shauld meet with <span class="loc">Tabo</span>, a small hamlet;. then <span class="loc">Pokso</span> or <span class="loc">Poh</span>, and then the fort of <span class="loc">Dankar</span>. The river has at this place two branches, which unite under the fort; the.left l~ranch is called <span class="loc">Lidang</span> and the right Syino, which is also the name of the next Purgunnah to .Spitin Tho following villages occur beyond <span class="loc">Dankar</span>, between .the two branches, but on- the Spim :-Tangtee, KGng, Khngrf, KGlling, <span class="loc">Salling</span>, and <span class="loc">Baro</span>. Bepond this he said he had no certain information. On the <span class="loc">Lidang</span>, again, ,which is about half the size of the Setlej, beyond bankar, these villages are met with:-Lara, Paling, and Rangreh. Thq <span class="loc">Lidang</span> comes from a peak called Kungtm <span class="loc">La</span>, about fifty. miles from <span class="loc">Dan</span>-. kar. The Syino's eource he did not know.

The path improves after rounding the corner, and the appearance of the mountains alters still more. The granitic and high sharp peaks give \Fray to low rounded mountains, with scarcely any snow on them, and still less vegetation ; nothing can equal the complete nakedness of this P~~rgnnnali of Hangarang, and it is a wonder how the people contrive to support themselves. <span class="loc">Nako</span> contains about thirty houses, and is situated on the western declivity of the PGrkyGl mountain; there are a few apricot trees, poplars and oziers, and barley and wheat, are grown still higher than the village, tlio~igh its elevation be nearly 10,000 feet, ' We noticed a curious appearance in this day's march, which we had af- terwards occasion to observe, was very common in this part of the country. It was a conformation of ice, having all the regularity of a vegetable pro- duction ; it seems to grow from the stalk oFa particular plant and from no other, it is fantastically disposed is leaves having various whirls or twists. The leaves as they may be called have a fibrous appearance, but grow (con- 'trary to the habit of real leaves) perpendicularly from the stem, like a pendant on its staff. We observed a great number of these glacial plants, (if they may be so called,) but whence tlie moisture came is difficult to say, for the ground was gravelly and arid. It is equally difficult to account for the ice assuming that particular form, and growing so as to raise itself seve- ral inches above the ground. It may be worth remarking that in every in- dance, the plant to which it attaches itself, aqd whjcb is a stpall leafy shrub? was withered and sear, The thermometer was in the morning 23" and all the water in our vessels Was frozen nearly ap inch thick, even inside the tent. From <span class="loc">Nako</span> to (3hang was a distance of one hundred and five miles; the path is' good the whole way, and the ascent which coptinues the first half, and descent' kop thence to <span class="loc">Chang</span>, are both easy ; several flats and hollows are seen in OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. <span class="loc">Sil</span> the vicinity .of <span class="loc">Nako</span>, and close to the village there is a small.lake of consi- derable depth. The declivity of the ridge is here very gentle, though on the opposite side of the river the steepness is established by the appearance of the road not leading along its face, but over the lateral ridges and descend- ing into the glens. At Chaq there is the same flat declivity ; on this side, red hard earth is seen to form hillocks that rise above the surrounding ter- rein, similar to turrets or the bastions of a fort. <span class="loc">Chang</span> is situated in the middle of a little flat, which might be almost called a valley ; .it is in some measure, or has been, the bed of a torrent, but the stream now flows deep below and far away to the right. To the left this valley is bounded by a. ridge of the hard clay, I have already mentioned, which separated it from. the collection of hillocks. Looking up in the direction of the glen, which has a very gradual acclivity, ad flat and retiring sides, the granitic peakb with snow on them are again seen, but of an inferior elevation. The village is rather large and like all those in Hangarang perfectly Tartar. The con- trast in appearance and language between this .race and the Kanhwaris,. was made more striking by the arrival of a man belonging to PGrbGnni in KanBwer, from Ladak, while we were here. He had come from <span class="loc">Leh</span> to <span class="loc">Lari</span>, a village two or three marches ahead, in fifteen days, and he informed- us that Runjeet Sinh had established a <span class="loc">Wakil</span> at <span class="loc">Leh</span>, and that the country. was considered subject to him, in the same manner as it had before been to ' Cashmir. The appearance of this Purgumah Hangarang, is mast strange and me- lancholy : mountains bare of forest, but above covered with a little snow, of the rounded form, with gentle declivities, but broken towards the river into abrupt and precipituus abysses ; in the beds of which where fed by a . stream, are seen a few trees, chiefly tbe osier, The rocks, though still a. good deal granitic, and felsyar common, yet are verging into clay slate of which there L much about this village ; above' Nakb, 'the ridge is of the trtie <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> form, rugged and precipitous, break* into pinnacles and crags,: but bare . .. even of the brown and scanty vegetatioa that in some pleaiure' $83.: COiJBSE AND tEVELS clothes tlle nakedness of these.

A road wlis pointed out to us, which they said leade to Ghrti,; the distance a journey of twenty-two daye. The road is pawlle for horses, though not very goad.

Indeed we had been uniformly assured that they wme passable for horses and thd ,no difficulty whatever would occur on this Bead ; but difficulties of a dif- . ferent kind, and less easy to be surmounted, presented themselves in the jea- . lousy of a strange people who owed us no allegiance, and our own cant of .preparation for such an attempt. The season, too, was far advanced, and it was known that in several parts of Kantiwer snow might be expected to fall daily. The apprehension that we should find some of the passes shut, apd the uncertainty under which we laboured as to our being able finally tp reach any poiat where me could winter, induced us at last, however unwil- , lingly, to resolve on returning. The difiiculty, too, which we felt on account of provisiops, was an additional inducement; and it was determined that mT companion ahould halt the next day, and on the following, commence his re- &amp;urn, while I, with a very few followem, should push on to the first Lataki village, from which I hoped by forced marches to overtake him. Lari was .zepreoented to ba, two marches, 8Gmra being the first, but the road was said to be good, and 1 thoaght it clssirable to make the attempt, if it were only for the sake of fixing the eztent of the frontier.

A little after day break I: left Skalkar, aecompani- ed by a servant, aix carriers, and a guide ; a long and laborious ascent, which however the path was excellent, brought us to the Lipcha pass, 8 ridge having an elevation of 3123 feet above <span class="loc">Skalka</span>:, which I have as ~bove supposed to be 10,113 feet above, the Level of, the sea. , So great wp fie cold, that, at ten o'clock, the ink froqe.

The view also extended up the bed of the Yang Cham river, which joins the <span class="loc">Spiti</span> immediately at the turn. It seemed to have rr great fall, and to be rather a rapid torrent than a river. On the opposite side of the <span class="loc">Spiti</span>, ap- peared an excellent road, which, I was told, was that leading by Chimarti to <span class="loc">Lari</span>, and 1 resolved to return by it, as it seemed to have fewer inequali- *ties than the one 1 had chosen. There were no peaks of euperior elevation .deen in any dii-ection, but the southern ; to the east, was seen a contimuation 'of the YGrkyGl chain gradually falling ofF, and with little snow on it. To the north, the left bank of the  rive^ rose into ~ound clay slate ridges,' which here and there shewed a solitary peak and eome little mow. To the west, 'were wen black bare mountains too low to retain snow. In fact, it appm- - ed to me, that the great chain of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> was to the south, and that, in this direction, the falling off had already commenced From the pass, the descend was steep at first, afterwafd's more easy, the path always good, though 1 think scarcely passable by mounted travellers : -after descending to the river bed, it leads along the water edge, sometimes cat out of ~recipitous crags in the form of a ledge, sometimes supported by scaffolding. This description, bowever, applies to but a very short distance, and after passing it, the road is again excellent. I arrived at SGmra about half pat four o'clock ; it is a small village, situated in rather an extensive flat or table land, the foot of which is washed by the river. On enquiring the distance to <span class="loc">Lari</span>, I began to think 1 might reach it with some exertion by night fall, but 1 learned with considerable mortification that it was on the other side of the river, and that there was neither jbula nor sanga to cross by. On questioning them as to its being fordable, they said it might be, but that the current was too strong, and the water too cold for me to attempt it. ,My wish however to gain a day urged me to make the attempt, and, with the support of two muscular Tartars, I forded the <span class="loc">Spiti</span> river. What made it not a little dangerous was a rapid about one hundred yards below the OP TfIE RIVER SETLRJ. ford, and by ml~ich, had the footing been lost, one must have been dashed b pieces. Tlie water was a little more than middle-deep, the currat strong though not rapid, the width about one hundred feet or more ; the rwnd smooth stones vhich formed the bottom were the cbief difficulty, as ttrey afforded no secure footing. The temperature of the w&amp;er was so low, that I found my limbs quite benumbed, and it was twne minutes before they recovered their feeling. With some little delay, my few followers got dl acrws, and we &amp;en found an excellent road the whole way to <span class="loc">Lari</span>. It lay sometimes in the river bed, and sometimes along a flat in which the ri- ver .bad cut its ohaanel deep m,d far to the left. The lqopntains entirely clay slate, and exhibiting in many places a declivity of tbe most u~deviatiqg regularity, fqrned of loose fragments, which rolling from above bad all taken the station assigned to them by gravity, We reached Larj by dark, and were furnished by tbe hospitality of the people with a house t~ shelter pnd firewood to warm us. The distance from Skalkar was s.ev,ea,em miles, pf two thousand paces eacb. This village js gitaated at the ~outbern -foot of the ridge, .which risee from $be narrow plain ,or valley I have already described, apd the width of which here .is abqut 0.w-third ,of a mile. The white houges of the small haplet of <span class="loc">Tabo</span> we seen about one mile and a half farther up. The culti- vation extends the whole breadth of this valley, that is from .the village to the river, but not far above or below. The river runs in a channel about 130 feet below this level piece, .and from the immediate bed, the mountain sidge on the opposite side rises. I have already described the appewance of th,ese chains, equally bare of sqow and of forest, and occasionqy hap- .. . ipg &amp;ir irregulq declivities concealed by the bsds o,f loose iq.men&amp; that . . .

It is small, consisting of not more than eight of ten families ; tlie houses are built of unbnrnt bricks ; such is the extreme dryness of the climate. In fact, scarcely any rain falls ; in May and June, a very little,. but during the rest of the gear the heavens yield only snow; rapour or dew must be totally unknown t~nder a temperatore generally below the freezing point. a   he shawl goat is said to be bred here. I saw none however, and f ratha suspect ftom their answers to my cross examination, that they were impoa- mg on me. Certainly they are not to be seen in any village to the sou&amp; ward of this, nor has the Bissahir government, however anxious, been yei able to introduce the breed either into Kanhwer or Hangarang. <span class="loc">Spiti</span> is the name of the Purgunnah which extends to the Losar vilIage, and LSpino the next Purgunnah. At <span class="loc">Dankar</span>, which is a fort, beneath which the two branches of the <span class="loc">Spiti</span> river onite, a kamdar resides, to whom they pay their I assessment. <span class="loc">Dankar</span> is about thirteen miles'frorn Lari, and in a westerly direction. The left branch of the <span class="loc">Spiti</span> is the  large^, and comes from the ~ur~unkd~ of <span class="loc">Spino</span>; the other has its origin near Lossar or <span class="loc">Losar</span>; they .had not heard they said of the establishment. of the Sikh aatbority ; they had never been at <span class="loc">Leh</span>, nor did they know how far it was from Lari ; they shewed considerable disinclination to answer any of my questions, and their answers were not satisfactory by any means. I left Lari early in the morning on my return, and got to SGmra by nine o'cIock. In fording the river, which I attempted without any assistance, 1 was very near being carried away by the current, having slipped in placing my foot on one of the large smooth stones with which the bottom was co- vered. The temperature of the water I found to be 36" 8: By evening-f arrived at Skalkar, where I found my companion had marched for <span class="loc">Lio</span>. I put up in one of the huts, which I fbund empty, and attempted to defend i . myself from the c~ld by lighting a fire, but the annoy mce of the smoke . , made the remedy as bad as the evil. . . * From ~kalkk, Uio' was represented to be a very long march, and the road ' extremely bad in places, but as I thought I should most probably find the encampment there, 1 set out early, intending, if possible, to reach it by night fall. The path gradually ascends, for five and three quarter miles, to <span class="loc">Che</span>- jang <span class="loc">Kanka</span>, a pass over one of the lateraI ridges which shut in the numer- ous streams that feed the river. These ridges are all ofgreat height, or rather the beds of the streams are of great depth, and to cross even one of them is nearly the labour of a day; the summit of this pass is a level piece of some extent, and we found eome huts and an attempt at cultivation. As it was now noon, I halted to allow the people to take advaxitage of the spring we found, and make a meal before they attempted the arduous task in front; the descent to, and ascent from, the Yulling river. The steepness of the opposite bank, and great height, seemed to defy all access to it, but the rear of my com-, ' panion's line of march, which was now perceived slowly ascending it, proved that it was to be surmounted, and gave us hopes of overtaking them before evening. At half past one we proceeded doh a most steep and dif- ficult declivity, in which the beds of loose fragments lying at a considera- ble declivity, afforded a footing as insecure as it was tiresome. A little above the bed of the stream, we passed through some more even ground, which appeared to be cultivated, though at this time there were no crops. The stream is rather large, and occasioned a little delay in fording it : it has its source to the westward from some lofty peaks that were partially seen, looking up the valley. At the place we crossed, a small rivulet r joins it, which issues from a rocky cavern in a very picturesque cascade. The waters of this fountain are so strongly impregnated with calcareous ) matter, as to deposit it on every thing it touches, and the cave is orna- .. ? aented with stalactites, something similarly to that in the DGn called Sansb Dhbh, though it' yields to this-latter in the number, size, and beailti of them. The rocks in the bed of the river are limestone, and the steep scarp which we had now to ascend appeared to be composed of cnlcareour) earth, of that description found in the plains, called Ronkar. ~btwith: 'standing the evidence I had had of .this pass being surmountable, when 1 s9Q COVJlSE AND LEVELS came to ascend it, I could scarcely persuade myself that what I had seen was real. In describing the difficuJties which a journey through these countries presents, it is not easy to adhere to a just discFimincltion to give an estimate as it were of the proportional dangers of each difficulty. Eveq the least rugged of tbese strange and uncauth scenes, to give a correct idea of it, almost exhausts language. Fpithet ia heaped on epithet till at length no stores are left to paint the succeeding scene, which rises still higher iq the scale of picturesque horror and danger. The contisual recurrence, too, of these descriptions, pecessarily having a tiresome sameness, takes from the effect.

We did not accept the offer, but many of our servante  mount^ thpnselv? ; some on ponies, oP THE RIVER SETLPIJ. ssi .ahd some on yaks. The reality did not disappoint the ideas we had formed of the road, it was with very little exception level, and without any excep- tion good, the whole way to Hang, a distance of nearly nine miles. A lit- tle beyond <span class="loc">Lio</span>, the river valley is quitted, to turn up that of a considerable feeder.. The declivities had here a gentler slope, and we were pleased in thie march to fall in.with a herd of ponies, mules, and asses, grazing on the mountain side; they appeared strong and hardy, particularly the mules; Chulling we passed half-way ; it is situated on the right bank of the stream in the bed, or a very little above it. Rang consists of three hamlets or more, the principal of which contains about twelve or fifteen houses. A temple of great sanctity in the opinion of the people, distinguishes this village ; it is a large building, and something similar to those of the plains ; a strange and mis-shapen red idol is the chief deity of the place ; but behind this image, on a kind of altar, or railed platform, are a number of other gods and god- desses, chiefly emall figures of copper or bronze ; the walls are painted with the most ridiculous and monstrous figures as large as life; and, allowing for the peculiarities of their productions in this way, the artist seems to have been far from contemytiblo. The name of this Purgunnah seems to be derived either from this village, or from some circumstance common to both. It is altogether ~hiietian in features, dress, language, and cuatoma, such as that of Polyandry, and the societies of Gelums or Monks ; the construction of manis or the long bencli- - of stones; and in religion, as the substitution of Lamas for the Brahmins of KanQwer, the mode of getting through the duty of prayer by turning a cylinder, and the general reverence and devotion with which the myste- rious expression, Om mani pad men -Hoong, is pronounced. In salu- tation they incline their heads so as to touch ; a ceremony which, assisted by the strangeness of their countenances and dress, has rather a ludicrous effect. There is no distinction of cast, and consequently no fear of defile- ment. They have no scruple = to food ; the manner of preparing it, or the pehon by whom prepared. Ablution is so far from a duty as with the Hindus, that it is a matter altogether dispensed with by these people, 'ih have some excuse in the inhospitable nature of the climate. Whateves their national virtues may be, it is certain that cleanliness is not to be reckoned among them. Their women live under no restraint, but freely expose themselves to view, not even deeming it necessary to shroud tha face in a veil or cloak. They have rather expressive though yecilliar coun- tenances, but their great charm is the ruddy complexion, which distinguish- es them from the fairest born on this side of the snowy chain. They pep- form all the labours of agriculture, except thbse of ploughing and prep* ing the ground, and they are nearly as hardy and robust as the men. It is a pleasing sight to a European to see a troop of them going to fetch water from the spring, not in the Asiatic costume with an earthen pot on the head, and their face shrouded by a cloth ; but in that of <span class="loc">Europe</span>, with ddy cheerful countenances, unconcealed and unsuspicious, and a wooden pail under the arm. These pails are made of the juniper wood which is found in Kanhwer, though not in Hangarang, and which is in appearance and scent not unlike the <span class="loc">America</span> ceda; they are made chidy qf a placa called <span class="loc">Ropa</span>, . <span class="loc">Rangarang</span> produces wheat, barley, iia, yhpar, and turnips, but no lice, not even the kind peculiar to high and dry eituations. There is but on9 season; the trees, which are stunted, are only to be seen near the villagas or in the beds of streams; they consist of a few apricots and willows, dog- rose, gooseberry, a species of currant, p thorny bush known at home by the name of whin, and two species of shrubs not familiar to pe, which pro, duce e~cellent fruits, the one yellow and acid about the size of a currant, the other red and mawkishly sweet. It contsina nine villages, the revenue of which is but 990 Rupees a year ; a spall trade is carried on with Lad&amp; md <span class="loc">Gertop</span>, to both which places there are good maas. From the latte~ place they bring salt and byangt wool, but no shawl wool, which seems to be all reserved for the Ladak market. From Ladak they bring Pasbmines ~4 other manufactures qf the shaprl vqol, but raw material appp t~ OF THE RIVER SETLBJ. 593 be contraband, as the greatest precautions are taken to prevent its being exported. A kind of coarse flannel or blanket stuff is manufactured here and at <span class="loc">Chang</span>, probably at all the other villages, but it seems to be in no great quantity. Ponies and mules constitute a great part of their wealth. Upon the whole, the purgunnah though barren and naked, poor and thinly inhabited, is no doubt capable of being made something of. It is principally perhaps to be valued as the door of a communicatian which might be open- ed with the Latakis and other Tartar tribes. . Our experience of the preceding day's march, and of the ease and quickness with which our mounted followers got on, induced us to accept the offer of two good ponies which was made us here. Mounted on them, we soon reached the summit of the Hangarang pass ;- an elevation which coincides with the limit of snow, and which is at the distance of about three miles and three quarters from the village. The thermometer at twelve olclock, in the shade, and defended from the wind, stood at 3A0. Hence we had an extensive view; the snowy peaks, Ralding and Zungling, were both visible. The summit of this pass, which is 14,412 feet above the sea, consists of limestone. This probably is the outgoing of the strata seen in the bed of the Yulling river. It is the only instance in which I have seen lime?tone at this great heigbt within the circuit of these mountains. From the pass, the first two miles and a half is very steep descent to a stream, which at one o'clock we found almost entirely frozen. To Sung- nam, the remainder of the road is good, the path leading along the bed of this stream which joins the Rushkalang below the village. The whole ' distance was 103 wiles : we fomd here the principal part of our baggage, which we had ordered back from Dabling in our expectation of being per- ~tted to proceed to Gku. As this village was large, and there was no X r 394 COURSE AND LEVEW , deficiency of supplies, and as we had been making rather severe marches ; we thought proper to give the people a halt. The Hangarang pass is the boundary of that purgunnah, and in descend- ' ing from it, we could not but observe how much even the separation of a single ridge can alter the general face and appearance of a country. The' naked arid barrenness of Hmgarang, was here exchanged for the green and lively picture of a forest of deodars, juniper and walnut trees. The difference was further perceptible in the luxuriant vineyards; the pro- duce of which was presented to us on our arrival, and the advantage oftwo crops in the year places it in a still clearer light. Wheat, oa, barley, . chenno, pbpar, ougal, and turnips, are produced; the three last following' barley, but wheat and chenna exhaust the soil. Wheat is sown in March,' and cut in July. Sungnam is one of the largest vinages in Kaniwer; it cannot contain, I think, less than eighty families. The people are all traders, like the rest of the Kanhweris. Wool they import from GBru, which they manufacture into Suklath or Sanklath, <span class="loc">Doru</span>, pankhis, and caps. Besides wool, they import salt from GBru ; their exports are wooden dishes, iron, horse shoes, tobacco,'grain, and raisins. The tobacco and iron they receive from Ram- pur, with specie also, in exchange for their woollen stuffs. This village is in <span class="loc">Sua</span> or Siiang, one of the sub-divisions of Kaniwer. It is situated on the left bank of the Rashkalang, a considerable stream which joins the Setlej below Chaeu;* there are also the villages of Gabbn, <span class="loc">Taling</span>, <span class="loc">Chmu</span> and <span class="loc">Rupa</span>; the two first are on the right bank, the two last on the left. The source of the river is in the high range called Darnak ShG, which separates Kaniwer from Ladak. On this side of the range, <span class="loc">Rupa</span> is the lad village met with, and on the other side Manes, a village of Ladak, is the first which occurs: from Manes to <span class="loc">Dankar</span>, is three day's OF TIIE RIVER SETLEJ. 895 joamey. This road however is not so goad as that by Skalltar and Lari, which is a journey of eighteen days. We were a little dismayed in the morning, by the appearance of a aer- vant reporting that it had been snowing heavily all night, and had not yet cleared up. On looking about us we found it was but too true, and that the snow lay about half a cubit deep ail round our tents, while tlie sur- rounding ridges and peaks had all exchanged their hue of green for the more dazzling, though not so pleasing, livery of winter. This was quite an unexpected event to us, though tlie probability of it had been frequently foretold,, but we always attributed their introduction of suc'h topics to their anxiety to see us fairly returning. We were a good deal perplexed;. not knowing when it m,ight clear up, particularly as we found there'was no low road to <span class="loc">Kanam</span> by which the danger of travelling over new snow, should there be a heavy fall, could be avoided. Most fortunately its cleared tip about ten o'clock, and tbe sun then breaking out, soon caused what had Mien io disappear, except on the highest ridges. The thermometer was at 31" during the fall. We immediately determined on taking advantage of this turn in our favour, however distant the probability of reaching Ka- nam by night fall. The great object, now the minter had evidently set in, was to get beyond the high ridge separating these two village% after which we should have no very high groupd to traverse, and ahould consequently be more independent of changes in the weather, The path leads down the Rushkalang for four miles, an easy descent and generally good, it then crosses tho'river on a sanga, thirty-three feet long and twenty-five above the stream. The ascent of the pass commenCes immediately from the bridge, and continues mod ste,ep to the summit, a dis- tance of three miles. We found a few patches of snow near tbe summit, soft, but of no depth. The thermometer was 3P'and it had begun to snow . lightly during the last few hundred paces ; however, we had the satisfac- Xx2 396 COURSE AND LEVELS tion to see before 11s a good road, o.n which wemight use the ponies we. had brought with us. We reached <span class="loc">Kanam</span> by dark, in a heavy fall of snow, which had gradually increased from the pass : our followers did not come. up till late at night. The distance. was thirteen miles anda quarter. . From Kanarn to <span class="loc">Jangi</span> was a distance of ten miles.  he' road good to the commencement of the descent to the Changti nala, which is certainly equal in danger and difficulty, to any thing we had met with. A mile of most steep and rugged descent, in which the nakedness of a rocky scarp was ill exchanged for a hard and slippery gravek mas finished by a regular flight of steps, that led into the bed of the nala. We crossed it on a sanga, not a little pleased we had left behind as this frightful precipice. There are two villages, Osbrang and Lipta, higher up this glen, and a roacF leads by the latter from <span class="loc">Kanam</span> by which this last dangerous and difficult descent is avoided : from the Cbangti nala to <span class="loc">Jangi</span>, is easy and moderate ascent ; the people of this village trade with Pateala and Ladak ; from the former place they imporb indigo, sal-smmoniac, baftas and spices; from the latter saffron which they call kesari; ingots of silver, and palhis or ti~nashis of which eight make a sicca rupee. Wool they receive from GBru, and salt from Hangarang and Gru. , From <span class="loc">Jangi</span> our next march was Rarang, a distance of nine miles ; the whole of the way a good path with very little descent or ascent. We had now got back to the region of forest, and the noble pines through which our route lay, at once gave the scenery its principal charm, and afforded us the real advantage of shade. We passed the confluence of the Tedhg, b river before noticed as crossed on the way up. We now learned there was a road up its bed leading to <span class="loc">Bekar</span>, and a small hamlet on one of its banks, a daj's journey from the Setlej. We passed <span class="loc">Rispa</span> also, and <span class="loc">Reiba</span>; in the latter, admiring the dislday of grapes laid out to dry, and with which every lionse in the village mas col ered ; at Rarang we found the Neoza in great quantities, and of au excellent flnvour ; the price was ten seers for the rupee. Walnuts also we found very good, but they had been brought from Pangi. . OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. 897 The weather was now extremely pleasant; the sun not too hot in the middle of the day to take exercise. In the morning the thermometer nt this village was 31" 5: The grapes had fully ripened, and we had baskets full offered to us at each village we passed through or halted at. We proceeded to <span class="loc">Pangi</span>, a distance of ten miles ; the path not so good as the preceding day's, though still not bad ; six miles is of a mixed kind, to a stream crossed on a sanga, in the bed of which lies the road formerly noticed as leading from Kanaln by Lipta and which crosses the Kasang pass. From this place there is a steep ascent of about three-fourths of a mile, through a deodar forest, in which we found a good deal of snow towards the summit. We overtook here a number of the Hangarang people, pro- ceeding heavlly laden to the <span class="loc">Rampur</span> fair. The remainder of the road was good and nearly level ; the proper name of this village, which contains about thirteen families, is Thempi ; there are several others close to and the xhole collectively have the name of <span class="loc">Pangi</span>. We observed, over the door of a temple here, the hide and horns of a curious animal, which had been kill- ed in hunting and which these people called Skin. There were also skins and horns of the War and <span class="loc">Ther</span>; they both go in herds ; tbe former is'some- thing like the musk deer, the face is however that of a sheep ; the hoofs are divided ; the horns are more like those of a buffalo than any other animal. The <span class="loc">Ther</span> is supposed to be the Chamois of the Alps ; it is called Sboo or Zboo by the Kanaweris. The musk deer (male) they call Robz, (the fe- male) Biz; numbers of them are shot all over Kanawer, pmtkularly in this vicinity. Half-way, or rather a little more, we breakfasted at <span class="loc">Chani</span>, a middling village opposite <span class="loc">Barang</span> nearly. We passed through Kashbir and left to- wards the river side the several hamlets of DGn, Brehle, Yuaring, <span class="loc">Sonan</span>, KGti, Kangi and Febling. On this side of the river the declivities of the mountains are more gradual, and in consequence not so bare ; for this reason also the villages are more numerous and the cultivation more extensive. 598 COURSE AND LEVELS - . As far as <span class="loc">Chini</span>, and- even for some distance beyond it, the path had been good, generally speaking ; between it and Rogi, however, there are one or two exceptions. The pass called Maning Chi, in particular, is avery rug- ged looking place, and the path leads along the face of a precipice at a great height above the bed of the river. Several flights of steps, construct- ed with loose stones and scaffoldings boarded, one of thirty feet in length, render the place passable, which it otherwise would not be. From the summit of this defile is seen a noble view, the principle feature of which is the Raldang Cluster of snowy peak$, which rise above <span class="loc">Murang</span> not above ten miles distant. The Harang ridge, which we had crossed in the march from <span class="loc">Sangla</span> to <span class="loc">Mebar</span>, was observed to be covered with snow to a consi- derable depth below tlie pass over it. To the south we saw the inner ridge of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span>, in which are the <span class="loc">Ganas</span>, Bruang and Rde passes. The main ridge is certainly marked ty the Raldang Cluster, and the Setlej may be said to break through it at <span class="loc">Murang</span> or below. The latitude of Rogi is 31" 30' 13~'. The elevation 855 1 feet. Rogi, I consider the southernmost village where the true costume of r Kaniwer is to be observed ; even there the people are very inferior in all that constitutes the peculiar appearance of the Kaniweris. They are much darker, and not so good looking, and their language is sensibly mixed wit$ tpk mountain dialect of Hindustani. At Sungnam, <span class="loc">Kanam</span> and <span class="loc">Raba</span>, the features which distinguish them alike from Tartars and the mountaineers south of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> are most strongly marked. Kanimer however as a purgunnah extends much farther down the Setlej. Between Rogi and Meru that river changes its course from a southerly to a westerly one ; at the turn it receives the <span class="loc">Baspa</span> river, and above the confluence is the village of <span class="loc">Brua</span> or Bruang, from which there is afoute by the pass of the same name over the snowy ridge into Cbuara. ,,From Meru to Spara Wodar,, an open spot in the bed of the river where pve ,encpped, was a . distance . of nearly thirteen miles. At Chegaon, rather i;a - OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. aubstaniial village about half-way, we stopped to breakfast, and admired a handsome temple with its gilt spire. From Chegaon the descent continues, and becomes rather difficult and even dangerous just before leading to the I river bed ; the path then continues along the level flat a few feet above the river. On the opposite side we noticed the <span class="loc">Melang</span> Glen far retired within the snowy range ; a considerable stream which waters it joins the Setlej ; a I pass leads up the bed of it into Chuara, but it is more difficult than either the Bruang or Role passes. With the exception of these deep glens, with which the mountain sides are every where intersected, there is little to admire in the scenery which this part of the valley of the Setlej displays. Naked and lofty precipices, or bare and broken declivities, present little to attract , attention, after the -first edge of wonder and fear is worn off; and we had seen so much' of this kind in the upper part of Kanhwer, that these features had now lost their power over us. We had, in ~acbeth's words, 66 supped. full with horror," and " direness familiar to our thoughts could not now start us.", Thermometer 420. From Spara ~odar the path tgraduall? ascends for ' about two miles, when there id a steep descent, chiefly by, steps, to the bed of the Babe or Wungar river, a furioi~s and rather large torrent, which is , crossed on a sanga of about 40 feet in length, and 26 feet above the stream. This ecene is really picturesque and romantic in a high degree. A purgun- nah, called the Babe, extends up the bed of the stream ; it contains the fof- lowing villages: Dhtarang, Gramang, <span class="loc">Yangpa</span>, Krabe and Kampanang. Immediately below the confluence of this river is the jhitla of Wongth, by L which the Setlej is crossed. There had formerly been a bridge here, the remaim of which are even yet visible; it was similar to that at <span class="loc">Puari</span> which I before compared to that at Wandipilr in <span class="loc">Butan</span>, and of which a view is given in Turner's <span class="loc">Thibet</span>. On each side are fixed several tiers of strong beams inclining upwards, and each tier projecting about five feet beyond the one below it. When the distance between the ends of these beams is reduced to about 40 or 30 feet, a few planks or spars of that length arelaid $00 COURSE AND LEVELS across, and the bridge thus appears at a distance to consist of three pieces which meet at an angle. The ingress to, and egress from it, is regulated by a guard house or choki on each side, which fills up the whole of the road way; and thus they serve as points of check to an enemy as well as of com- munication to friends. Thie bridge had been burned when the Gurkhas attempted to penetrate here, and though we admired the spirit of the act, we could not help regretting the loss of the bridge, forced as we were to cross a rapid and powerful river on a tar or single rope. We arrived at the jhtila at half after nine a. m. and at half after three p. m. when I left it, there still remained several loads on the opposite side. The distance of Nichar where we encamped, from it was four miles and the whole distance was seven and a quarter. Nichar is situated high on the mountain side, and the declivity is much more gradual, so that the ground is open about it and rather level. From Nichar our pat stage was Trade, or Trandeh, to <span class="loc">Punda</span>; the path was tolerably good, with partial ascents and descents, leading sometimes 2hrough fine forests of deodar. From Ptinda the path turns up the Saldang glen, remarkable as forming one of the most romantic and beautiful scenes I have noticed. The ri~er is rather a cataract having a great fall and form- ing a complete bed of foam; the sanga on which we crossed it was twenty feet in length ; besides the main there are two smaller branches. The ascent from it is rather steep partly by steps in the rock. The last mile to the village is nearly level, the path good, passing a pretty cascade which falls from the brow of a rock ints a basin which it has worn for itself. Trandeh, or Trade, is a neat village and pleasantly situated. Lofty deodars at once shde and adorn it, aed the houses are substantial a&amp; well built. 'Thermometer 36" .51: Hoar frost m the ground.

Half-way the KandlanuHah iscmssed, a! picturedque spot where we stopped to breakfast ; thence is a steep aucent to Manouti Danda, a ridge which is reckoned the boundary of KanBwer; ],ere the aspect of the river valley changes in a remarkable manner, The left bank having scarcely any declivity but spreading out in a nearly level expanse for at least' two miles down to the water's edge. The whole of the motmtain eide is well cultivated and at this time presented the golden picture of a plentifur harvest. The hamlets are numerow too, tbaagh lamall, and the appearance of the country upon the whole is highly pleasing.

We found the fair nearly full, though - there 'were still every hour ~artars and Kaniiwaris coming in with heavy loads chiefly of the byangi or Tartar wool. Rampor is situated on a strip of level ground by the river side, and is a emall towd, consisting like <span class="loc">Saran</span> merely of people attached to..the <span class="loc">Raja</span>'s person and a few <span class="loc">Banias</span>; above the town is the <span class="loc">Raja</span>'s house; .rather a mean building of. naked stone with occasional layers of wood as usual in buildings in the mountains. The roofs are curved something in. the man- ner represelited in Chinese pagodas ; some pains hare been taken to form and preserve the ground'in a tolerably level surface ; forming a series of platforms and banked up with stone. On each side of the river (on the town eide close) rise lofty and rather steep mountains, which seem to.be the cause both of a greater degree of cold and heat than would be experienced were the place more open. The sun at this season of the year is not seen till past ten o'clock, so that the mornings feel. insupyortabl y cold, while the afternoons, owing to the reflection 'of the sun's rays from the mass of,mound bin so near, and partly perhaps from the effect of contrast, appeaf to be aa much too hot ; the day we arrived however rain fell which prevented .our feeling the heat. The two following days we were much incommoded by it, The 12' might be called the last day of the fair which had only lasted two days, though three is the term generally allowed. The 13th there were few people and on the 14th they had all disappeare'd except the fixed re&amp; dents. The town as I have already remarked is situated along tlre river bank, on a small level piece, about 400 or 600 yards in' length and 100 broad. Here it is the people assemble and range themselves in two rowa fating each dther, each with his merchandize befure him; the wool and ialt or Tartar, traders, taking one side, and the 'grain; €kc. orelower mom7 taineer* the othet.

With but little assistance from language, this multitude of people adjust their bargains with wonderful rapidity ; the several loads disappear 'aa. quick as they grrive, transferred to new hands, so:tbat there is a continued succession of arrivals, and a vivacity .and bustle are communicated 'to the scene that render it highly amusing. - The total number of people assem- bled could have hardly exceeded 3000; of these the Tartars and Kanslweris brought wool pd pashrn ; the latter also woollen fabrics for barter; Sank- lath, Yankhis, <span class="loc">Dhris</span>, kc. also raisins and neozas (seed of a pine) and some of thpm and. of the Tartars, Pashminas from Ladak, a coarse kind of sl~gwl, whicb costs from eight to forty rupees according to'its quality: The . lower mouptgineers bring grain; iron, spices, cloth, sugar, and other articles; a pumber of pe~ple from KGllG (a mountain state, separated from ,Bissahir by the river) also visit this fair. They cross some by.the'tar or bridge of a single ;rope (whicb is here ninety yards in length,)and some on distended skins which -would appear to be both a safe and expeditious hanner ,of p~ssing a river *at hw pot boo great a fall. . .,. ., . On the 15th. we marched for Nirt ; the route lay 1ittIe.above the level of the river and the increasing. temperature gave us sensible proof, how great our descent had been from <span class="loc">Seran</span> ; the path is ;generally tolerable and the river appears to flow with a placid current and is little obstructed by rocks. The Naugri river, a considerable stream, joins tbe Setlej about half-way ; it 11as its source in the falling off of the inner range of the <span class="loc">Hima</span>- ' laya which . . divides the river vallies of tbe Setlej and Paber. We crossed , it on a sanga seventy-two feet long and twenty-two feet above the water, rather narrow and springy : a good deal of fiat or table land ita seen alittle farther on near Dattqnger, and a substantial village on the opposite side of the river called Ninnunda.

LEVELS From Nirt to Kotgerh was rather a long march; the distance being about a nine miles; we did not arrive till past twelve, and found the ascent from $he bed of tbe river extremely fatiguing, owing to the heat more than the .steepness. Our cmstitutions having been so long accustomed to the bnc- dng air of the <span class="loc">Himalaya</span> tract, were little prepared te encounter the heats which even at this season prevail in a river valley, so narrow and so deep ae this of the Setlej. The temperature of Kotgerh however which is be- tween 3 and 4000 feet bigher, we found'agreeable, and a few days affer our arrival we had a heavy fall of snow. From Kotgerh the journey cwtinued along the banks of the riverto with- jn a few marches of <span class="loc">Belaspur</span>, but as little worthy of description occurred in this part of the ,route, and as this narrative has already swelled to a aize sot originally contemplated, I shall conclude my remarks . here, referring .the reader to the appendix for the few particulars of acientific import col- lected. In the appendix I hare given an idea of the construction of the -map and. of the methods by which the few points of level bed were d&amp; termined. There will be found also two short wcabularies, one of KanC weri, the other of Tartar words, and some other particulars that were omit- -4ed in-the narrative. The reader will thus be better able to judge of the aalne of .the few reeults fixed by this journey, as also what may yet remain .desiderata in that interesting quarter of research. OF T.nE RIVER SETW. A'PPENDIX. THE journey of which I have attempted to give some account in.the preceding pages was undertaken as before mentioned, for the purpose of .a laying down the course and levels of the RIVER SETLEJ. It will be pro- per therefore now to give aa idea of the manner in which these two ob- jects were accomplished and also to indicate some of the results. This ac- count of the operations has been separated from the Narrative as little likely, to afford interest .to the general reader. A reference to the accoupanyiw Map will render what follows more intelligible. 1. The particulars on which are founded the positions of the principal points in the mountain survey between the Satlej and Alakananda riven have been detailed with sufficient minuteness in the preceding volume of . the RESEARCHES. Of those points however depending on the chain of Triangles, but few offer thems,elves ,to the assisfince of the Surveyor in his task of laying down the course of this river. A great part of the route described in the preceding pages lies north of the snowy Peaks ; wd it had not appeared possible at that time to carry any' connecting triangles across that range. The points of verification therefore on which theac- companying MAP depends, and the elevations indicated in the SECTI~N being obtained (with only me exception) by less accurate methods than those on which the southern portion of the'Map rests, it is my intention to give a brief but particular account of the data on which they ', are ... founded. 2. The first of these (and the most to be depended on I consider) is the . latitude of the plilce. The following Table contains the results of all the ob- - I servations 1 made. The instrument was Troughton's Circle, No. 44, men- tioned in the former paper. Altliough it was free . as - fq as: I coilld ever perceive from all collimation, yet, to render the results entirely indepen- .40G -COURSE AND LEVELS dent of this correction I made it a rule to observe two stars, at least, when practicable. If north and south ; on the same side of Zero : but if both north or both south ; on different sides. This method of observing rendered me also independent of the error in the place of Zero and when the stars were nearly of the same altitude and on different sides of the qenith ; of any little error, in the adjustment of the glasses, or of the co-efficient of refrac- tion.

The Immersions or Emersions of Jupiter's Satellites that were observed have been already published, being used to fix the .longitude.of  FIRST MERIDIAN of the I survey. It was considered that the errors of such results as a comparison *ith the Nautical Almanac could furnish, would be much greater than those even of the imperfect methods finally resorted to.

The three snowy peaks Rgildang, the Needle, and L, were observed here. The aqgle subtended by $be first two was 440 51' 30~ by the second two 13" 54' 80". These data aeord excenent means sf fix- ing the Paas by using the elegant formula of Delambre. It would bow- ever in this case be necessary to calculate the respective distances of the three paks, on which account, aa well as the favorable situation of all three points, I have chosen a less direct method by using the bearings and as7 suming a latitude for the pass. The place of Magnetic Bast and West on the Limb was always observed with great care on these occasions, a magni- fier being used to observe the coincidences of the Needle (wliicli was fre- quently made to oscillate) with the line of 90" in the compass Lox. In every case the slow motion screw was used for making the coincidence perfect ; and as the same precautions were taken in observing the decli- nation of the Needle, it is evident that the Magnetic bearings for near ob- jects were nearly as good as Azimuths. The true bearings then of these three peaks observed as 1 have described were 53" 53' 98"; 44 30 and 1 12 39. The latitude af the pass is assumed to be 31" 2l'O$*'. With these data and the position of RBldang the longitude is found to be 78" 8'27; and with this longitude and the position of the Needle the latitude ap- 1 pears to be 31' 21'03': With the same longitude and the position of L. we shall Qlzd the latitude 31" 21'95YThe elevations will be found OP THE RIVER SETLEJ. ~rc&amp;.Rbldang (L. of E. 3.48.53) 15.567 feet.

No watch that I have OF THE RIVER SETLU. 411 evei seen or read of, had a juster title to confidence than thia one; I mean judging'from its previous performance. ! ' 7. A few particplars more remain to be noted, on <span class="loc">Lapcha</span> Pass, the bear- ing of PGrkyGl Peak was observed 130" 54'Cor. for declination 133' 49'. Tile protracted latitude of the Pass (from Sb;alkar) was 52" 02'5G"froa hese data we obtain the longitude of the Pass 78" 32'07". Some mistake committed in observing or recording the angle of altitude prevents its be- ing used. But from the Snowy Peak Rishi Gangtang (fixed by protraction) Bnd having an elevation of 21,229 feet, as observed from <span class="loc">Tashigang</span>, the of this pass would appear to be 13,468 feet. The angle of altitudb . was 2" 39'50" feet. This resnlt is in some measure confirmed by the angle of altitude of the Pass observed at Skalkar combined with the protracted aistance and elevation of tbat place. 8. In the Survey of the ROUTE an excellent Tlleodolite was used for the bearings, distant points being freely used as cheeks on the protraction. The distances were determined by TIME. Such a rnetl~od will be tlronght per- haps loose and inaccurate ahd. so no doubt it is; but when it 1s borne in kind that such is the rugged nature of these roads that in whatever manner 0 1 the measure be taken, it will require to be reduced from ii to iobefore it can 1)e used for .protraction, and jhat this reduction must depend entirely on es- timation, there will appear little cause for preferring (except on the score of convenience, any of the three methods which I have been in the habit of employing during my labors in tl!ese mountains, viz. PERAMBULATOR MEA- SUREMENT, PACING, or TIME. I may also add that I had well exercised myself in the number of paces whicll may be taken within the minute, on every quality of path, and that this number was always iliserted in the field \ book at the time, as was likewise the reduction of the road line to the . . straight one for protraction. 2 s 3 412 --. .COURSE AKD LEVELS , 9. With regard to the elevations ewp~emed in the SECTION 8 EBw of them rest od ~rigonometrical meaauremeqt us (already detailed), the others uq deduced from the following Table of Observatims made of the temperature of boiling . , water. The Thermometer I used was the largest procurable i it had a scale af 40" to an inch. The boiler mas a copper vessel about twelve ' inches in height and two in diameter. It was provided with a Use bottom at a height of three inches above the lower one. This was pierced with holes kd the water poured in till it reached to about three inches above it.. The ihermorneter was then placed is it so that the bulb was fully covered witb water. The reading was made with the assistance of a magnifier of about . . five or six incbes focus which was held quite out of the reach of the steam, the vessel being always ope; and the steam quite uneonhed. I had found that any thing held over the mouth of the boiler even though it did not half close it, had the effect of raising the temperature. But by Boiling in the manner I bave described I had very consktent results. It will appear perhape a matter of regret that I had not the THERMOMETUICAL Barome- ,ter described by AR~HDEAGO~ WOOLLABTON. This Instrument however is not made of suficient extent aa yet to comprehend within its range the boiling pointa given in the fdlawing Table. Z mean without using the me- .thod of boiling and tapping as described by the inventor. This metho4 would have been of less easy application in a journey hurried as this neces- sarily was from want of supplies, than in the easier journies through civiliz- ed Eurape. I can think of nothing which the common Thermometer wants to reader it perfectly adequate to these measurements, beyond some enlargement of ib scale, and a division into inches and decimals by a veE- i One-fourth or even om-fifth af an inch to each degree would he an- ply sufficient. 10. In the following Tabfe.1 have added a.colurnn shewing the corrected : result ; the mama of obtaining it will be explained a little farther on. - Date. 30 Nor. I THE ~I$ER SETLEJ.

In deducing the Elevahons given in' this Table I have used the fol- lowing comparisons made with the same Thermometer and an excellent 414, ,- COURSE AND LEVELS Barometer filled with Mercury revived from Cinnabar and well purged of air. These correspondences being compared with Dalton's Table of the force of steam (Thomson'a Chemistry, vol. i.) give the errors of the Thermometric scale, hnd from them the subjoined little Table is calculated by' interpolat- ' ing the intermediate numbers. Using this Table to correct the indications of the Thermometer, 'the corresponding Barometer is taken from Dalton's Table, and the height deduced therefrom in the usual manner, correcting for the temperature of the air as directed by M. Etamond in calculating single observations of the Barometer. It is known that without corres- ponding observations, the results of Barometrical measurement are likely to be erroneous. To this error the method by boiling is also subject. But in these climates, where the Barometer is so much more regular in its indi- cations than in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, this error lies within a less compass. I find from a register kept very carefully at <span class="loc">Saharanpur</span> that the Maximum annual range is only 6 inches and in any one month not more than 4 inches. This error 8' cannot then affect the boilings by more than 300 feet in the extreme case, ahd generally much less. But they are subject also to their own error, aris- ing as well from the smallnGss of the scale as defect of observation. Every precaution was taken to reduce this last within as narrow limits as possible: Still 1 am afraid the error may have 'amounted in some case's to half a de- gree. It is hardly credible that both these errors should- lie the same way ; and yet we see that jn the Elevation of the Pass something of this kind must have occurred, for the result by boili,ng exceeds that of Trigonometri- cal measurement 551 feet. I need scarcely say that with regard to the pu- rity- of the vater used I was most scrupul'bus; 1'6nd it difficult therefore to anderstand the above anomaly, unless it be nferable to the uncertainty of tb.e correction for the temperature of the air. , 8.

Spara Wodar again the elevation is 533a feet ; and at Wongtb JhGla 5289. . Th.e mean Q£ theae, 53 13 is taken as the deuation.also of the intermediate point. Now the distance by the Map is 60 miles dr,allowing 1 6' for the devious windings . . of a mountain river TO ; the fall is 4 119 feet, or 59 feet, nearly, per mile. Again, at <span class="loc">Batorah</span> the level is 2181 feet, and at Stni 2083 feet ; mean 2132, or below WongtG 3181 feet. The distance being 53 (or correcttd 6-21 gives a fall of 51 a feet n'erirly. The present survey of . the . river terminated at Sli~ll but j~ldging from the qalogx of other rivers, I infer that it has a further fall of 1000 feet to ~200, before it . reaches the plains, in a course of about 36 miles. The total fall from Shipki would then be about 8400 feet. Captain Webb in his visit to the <span class="loc">Niti Pass</span> informs us (Journal of Science, vol. ix.) that the bed of the Setlej hak # - there an elevation of 14,924 feet. This is A401 feet higher than the level near Shiyki. The course of the river would appear to be about 1 lomiles, so that here also the fall is between 50 and 00 feet per mile. At Shipki the river has a mean width of about 100 fket ; the depth I did not measure, but 3 should suppose it to be about R feet. These data, with the aboje fad, hsing the Chevalier De Buat's fortnula would indicate a velocity of abottt 200 feet in the second, or nearly 12 miles an hour; a resuIt certainly too high Frim LarI to the confluence, the fall of the right branch or <span class="loc">Spiti</span> Riser is ~$41 feet ; the distance being 33 miles or corrected as before 3'6- Here therelore the fall is 82 feet 5 inches per.mile. A course of 50 br Ob, OF THE RIVER SETLEJ. miles abo,ve this point reckoning it to have the same declivity, would bring its waters under the influence of perpetual frost. 14. Some differences will be observed between the results given in this paper and those contained in the former.

With respect to the written cha- I racter in Kadwer I cannot speak with certainty, but in the Bhotia or 1 Tartar villages they have the urnma and Sirma characters (or printed and written) of <span class="loc">Thibet</span>. The general resemblance of the former both in their forms and names to .the Sanskrit bas been noticed. I have now before me aa alphabet (or ka, kha, as he called it) written by the Lama Ring Jing d Dahling, and comparing it with that given in Yates's Sanskrit grammar ihe rmemblance is very kking; There are hoaever differences, chiefly unim- I portant ones in the aanner of forming #he .characters. This Lama had a book printed in this character, the letters yellow, on a deep blue ground ; it was ornambted also with pictures of their gods or heroes, painted with very bright and vivid colors but without any idea of keeping or persyectjve.
