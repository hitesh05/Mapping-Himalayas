'The fort of * Jasntgeth is not f'dr diflant on the oppolite fide, and the road to Skina~r croEs the river a 1ic:le way below the village. As 1 had much ans'iety to viGi Jumnotri and Gnngotri, the Sourccr. of the rivers 3u:nna and Govgts, (or rather of the Bhagirathi, the princi- pal lacred lource of the <span class="loc">Ganges</span>) placesof peculiat lanaity.to the Hi:/dus;. I profi+ed by an opportunity bclter than could ever again occur, and parting fi-o~n my brother, who purbed his way to Sirinagar, took, with as fsw attendants as was c~nfiffent with prudence and neceffary comfort, the road which leads to the firR mentioned place. - T 1- Ccfht pafi g o'clock, the road winding in a generid direillon to N.

On our way to this point we ~affed through one or two villages, but the cultivation is neither extenfive nor promifing. From thie Ration an exteniive view would have been obtained including <span class="loc">Birat</span>, Badrdj. and feveral of the hius above the Drhra Din, as well as the exten five - - 7- - - r - * 'Jan*tgcth I. the place to which H~vten~~#r Slnc retrutcJ afttt rhe errcurtio~i 0b KJ*"&amp;a, and from w' el ce $1 ~~I-RALDOCK W~S ~e~ulled by hira. $ From (trbo, we had bearings of yawl, Bird rod Badr*; .range, on which Jauntgfirh is fituated, with a generatview of .the I courfe I \ ,of the 'Juirtngr, from the fnowy mountains to CaE/i; but this was pre- .vented by a thick fog which enveloped the tops of the mountains, . and only now asd then gave to view ape.tk, glimmering through miR. Prom hence we entered on a .very deep clefcent into the bed of a fmall but .rapid Rrearn, called ~~t'~r~~i'-G~'d''h~ The valley. or hollow . of which this forms. the drain,. is. fibgularly formed by the meeting of . two hills, .or ranges by a hail ridge, no great dilfance from the river ; and the mwth is far. more narrow than the.hollow above. It contains the Bander-Chat, (or divifion). and there is a contderable.quantity of . detatched cultivation, wheat, barley, rice, cottan, and a brain, callea athino, refembling bird-feed, . fcattered through it ; the ri~e hrt as ,in ohcr parts of the- hills is neatly cultivated oa levelled *Edges, over which water is led in fmall coudes, taken from th.e fiream far~above, It is a wild and rugged rdvine, and -the. hlus. rife, very .iuddenly to ' their height. . 4 THrr deknt from Chdmri- Ca-chat is very irregular. and iigozag, fevere and painful ; paffing through Cot'hlzl, a village deItroycd .by tho ~~~t'h~s; we croffed the Got'har nullah, and reached the village of Lok9ho Mlmldaal, Ctuated almoR on he banks of the river.. This villageis clainled both by Gwxuhal and Sirmor ; it cultivates the lands of each flaw, and P ays tribute to both ; it feems entirely appropriated .to the.mainteMnce of fev&amp;al temples, and their prielts, and there are Iome fine rich b P ieces of land on the bank8 of the <span class="loc">Jumla</span>, as well rs of a nullah, a &amp;rc t . \ray further on, fet aiide for tiis holy purpore ; for which the village is affefled by each itate.

One curious Rone reprerents in relief a large affemblage of Hindu divinities, among whom GANE'S'A, DUBGA; BHAVA'NX Bc. &amp;c. sere readlly recogi. nifed. A narrow cavern leading under ground through the rock from the village to the river fide, ufed, it is faid, by the people of the country in times of danger, was ihcwn us, but we did not explore it. Opposr TE to this vl~lage, Barni-Ci-Ga dmh, a large firearn which has its rife in the lofty peak of Bongi-Ca-Tiba dabouches into the 3;rm,,d. In the Rnvine we obferved a curioufly Stuated houle, or fort, built upon afmalt rocky eminence, quite infulared in the middle of the firean. Its name was Biraltu; and it belonged to a zemindar of fome conre- quence, BHU'V SINH. OUR roite now lay alopg fome table land juR on the river bank : paGng ~andcr~crri, a ruined fort on a (mall r~fing ground above th- road, we defcended to Nccrpl-Ci-~i~d'h, which fiream is raid to bc r he boundary between Go-wbal and Sirmor ; but there appears to be a fort of land debateable around LaRha-a-,ncmdal, which contains fcme ipots of land, far richer than that generally met wilbin the hills, Nciaf- Cit.Ga'di is very confiderable, and is Said to take its rife in I'hir-a&gt;z.~a. Tt'ba, nearly two days journey to the N. W.; its immediate bdnhs are rocky and wooded, and much fine alder wood grows on them, as weli as on thofe of the Jwnna. AFTBR a harp afcent up a bare rocky hill, a rough path along its £ace brought us to Bauc'hauli, a large aqd apparently populous village, bjgh above the river, and wheq~ we rested for the night. 1 he place of . . . .

The villa~e has the appearance of having once been more con fi. der~ble; thechief zemindar or <span class="loc">Stana</span>' (as he is called) when quefiioned with regard to its population, averred that it had but 28 houCes, and contain about loo inhabitants; but his anrwers were helitating, obrcure and prevdricating ; and I fufpect he believed that the queitions put were preparatory to lome affeffmment or tax, which prevented the &amp;ruth from being told. 1 ihould have thought the village mu[t have full 250 inhabitants ; it is not exaaly a part of any purgunnah, but in lome mealure is attubed to RcwL7tn. AT 7 o'clock nrxt morning we left Banc'hauli', and proceeded Rill dong the left hand face ef the hiil above the ~URLM, following 1 he deep indentings, and long rcn.mds of the vallies, wilh varrous irregular afmntl and del'cents, till, by a very rough and clambering path, we reached the top of Gangani-Ci-Dha'r, in a point called <span class="loc">Gangas</span>;- Ca ~'ha't. This 'balcony is very highly elevated, and commands bah and downwards, a moR extenfive and noble view, though par- tially obrcured by clouds. From hence we obtained the firR dillin9 view bf BEnder ~u~,$'h, the mountain, from a part ,of which the Yurnna bas its rire ; it (hews in two peak, both very white in fnow, and of great magnitude and height. The bed of the :3uw7a.looking down- wards,is narrow, deep and rocky, fave where the few grew fpob around Loihn rnaOd;lhl, relieve the eye ; upwards it runs in a far more fertile country, with table land and culrivation on its banks aqd kveral willages i il-hilc the hdb nope more eafily down to tbe level part, ce I 70 B'CCOUNT OF A JOURNEY. 70 THE SOURCES OF TEE; I lered with a variety of foreR foenery, and fpotted with fields. Further. up they frown and cldfe, and are of darker-hue. beyond, and-above all 'Jamnotri towers above. the clouds. i A ROCKY, tangled and unfrequented path brought us to a further- ghat or pars, where information was given, that a valley of confidera~ magnitude lay to our left, Aretchiirg from the Jymnu to the wellward, and in hopes of keing fo unufual a thing in thefe rugged hills, we / left-the road to make the trial. MTe were however difappointed upon . reaching the ridge, whence it was thought it might be fin, nothing appeared, rave the lower part of a ravine entirely-of the fame narure as the reR of the country, and which has here the name of S~'ri4a7k Ci-Gab. Abow it is calkd Rdma Semi, and 1 obtained only the ,following particulars defcriptive of the place. \ THE oldjnd ruined fortrefs cailed Sircet, is fituated on a high TGd; - of the fame name, at the end of the lofty range Ce'dar-Cada, which*; ' firetches down from me fhoulder of Bender Pwh'h, two or three cos . further up in this mountain ; the flream Rams, has its iource at a fpot , / called Shah, and is joined by Everai others from the fides of this as well as from. Sircd, and from the dnge which forms the orher Gde of the vally, called Remi-Ci-Dhar. JuR at the end of this lait mentioned range, which was in view from the point we flood on, the valley of ~a'ma Serai commences, and runs up to SircoE for a difiance of from 5 to 7 c6s, probably about gmiles ; the direttion, judging from. that of the mountains, and poEion of the points we ice, along with their formation given, may be nearly N. E, and S. W. Xhe b~eadth free x mile to 2$, and it is level throughout.

FROM hence, the road winds pmtty conhntly albng the river bank : the heat was exceifive both in our defcent, and in the low grounds. A en miles onwards we pafid ~clun~ra/-~rkh, an old ruin, which Rands on a peninfular rock, from 150 to zoo feet high, boldly projcaing. into the river; it was lately occupied by DHAMAN <span class="loc">CHAND</span>, AHMED.

The term Rotilkt, as far as I could underitand, is ap- plied to a Ton of the R'a, born of a nave woman ; and this. refidence was entirely appropriated to there conneRions of the roy- al family ; it appears to have been of confiderable extent, but con. itruCted much like the urual houfes of the fmall T'ha'ccirs we haie reen, in our tour ; it is now however in ruins, having been burnt threc- years ago by fome difconteilted mindars.

D~RING the courk of our tour, it was peculiarly obfervable, that the . . rocky and more abrupt faces of the loftieR hills, in the whole extent from the plains to the fnowy range. pointed in a north weRer1y direc- tionj but varying very much, according to iituation and cimmffances ; and that the oppoue faces, though always rough and .unequal, were more iloping and leis precipitous : tRr s difpolition was more confpicu- ous anddi Itin&amp;, the further we entered the hills and the xucr approached the high rocky perks of the fnowy rap.

Thok trees and ihrubs which are met with l~hrough the whde range of this hilly tra&amp; are allo ken here, and there are krerd additions, which could they be botanically defcribed, might be interefling.

A rocky ridge divides the large femicirclc before us into two parts ; in the back ground of that bn the left hand, the 'caflern peak cf Bender-puch'h rifes to a prodigi.ous heighth ; whllc from its bm fom itretches down a large hollow of deep how, cut into ravines, and precipices of a fearful heighth, The mountain itfelf exhbits one . huge howy mafs, without lpeck or dlain. ON the right, Surniru Parbat, a peak hardly inferior to Btndcr-~~~h'lr, , forms the center of a fnowy hollow, as rugged'and deep as that to the kft ; from each of thefe, firearns arife, which unite, and form Bhim. ci-Gcid'h ~t a very ihort diRance from hence. As we were but a very fiqrt way from thefe hollows of fnow, we obtained a beiter idea than we had any opportunity to do before, or the vaR thicknefs to which ir has accumulated. .

Among other ihrubs, to-day we remarked the common juniper, eafily recog- ' nifed by its berries and CmeJL July I~.-THE morning was cold and foggy; by a little after dby lighe- we were in motion, and continuing our'courfe to the very top ofthc glen, croffed Cinil-cAGad'h, jut? as it leaves the boforn of fnow below Bcndcr- fich'h, upon a bridge of ice ; hence crofsing the point Formed by the- junnion of' the two water courfes, we palfed many of the fmall Rreams that form this eaiternmofi branch of the BAh d-Gdd'h, and commenced; i very difficult ifcent along the principal-one which fallr here 6om a large rnafs of fnow and continues to run under it ; this. was an exceed&amp;- ! ingly painful part of our. road, as the afcent was very itecp and flippery. The ground was here bare and the grafi Runted, yet there were Rill plenty of flowers ; a. litrle further on, vegetation decreafes nil1 more; hardly sty-' thing being- ken, where the. ground 3s bare of how, fare a fcanty green sflime and brown mofs, like that found on barren ,damp grounds: A baron or hoilbw was here formed in the mountain of fnow, and the ruins of the- peaks around, heaped on- each other. It .was exceedirlglp cold, and a: moderate warmth even, was. only preferved by the toilfome exelrife of climbing thefe heighths. Many of the cooleys, and feveral of the fepoys, both GorR'hb and Mmsti now began to lagi and were hdrdiy able to proceed; and every one complained. of, the poifon'd wind. I.now began to IufpeA that tiis C~lppored poilon was nothing more than theeffe&amp;, whichthe rarefied nate of the' air, from the great heighth-we have reached, has on the lungs, and this fup-- pofition 1 .;is led to -frame from my own fcnf,tions ; I could hardly command firength .enough to climb the Recp rocky path, and expcrien- ccd in breathing much difficulty and.opprefGon, as'if there were an in- f~lffrciency of air. I do net. that we could- long have borne it, had 30MNA AND BEA*G~'RAT~HI' RIVERS. 307 tbc afcent continued much further. In this baron we paged a finall pool of water, held very ficred ;' it's name is ~itri.ci'-~dl, and &amp;om ib the chief Qeam of Rhim-ci-Gad'A iku: it is filled with ice and furrounded with fnow, Fsoaa -hence we paired over another hollow and fleep afcent of Bow, which lies deep on mallis of bare rock, and reached the top of the ridge called BanffirL-d-Ghdt. The cold was very great, and it was painfdto remain any time in inaaion, yet every one was indifpof- cd to move, and a- tendency to fleep was very perceptible. The moa ment that any one who complained much of the oppreflion at EircaE lay down4 hc inItantly dropt deep, and wgs with difficulty roufed. Eating zfew mouth-fulls gave a Lbghr did, but nothing materially ' alleviated it, nor was any one free from the weral' Tyrnptomr of dew bility. IF the lirie can be drawn with any .degree, of%xa8nefs, the bottom oE this afcent appears the extreme hcighth to which vegetation extends. At. the top, ,thest is not even the dull. mob or. lichen feen below ; the nones are bare. and unchanged, except by the air ; and no fign of life appears, .except a few rchlfs, andthele Bcw together in coveys, . - THIS being probably the highen point to which. we were likely ta r aicend, I %took particular notice of the rocks which compofed the mountains: -fragments.of.which chiefly formedsthe ridge we flood up- ' on. .

In the time of the ~orc*h' pot- er, 45 were thus benowed ; but, by the pa~zdit's account, who related thefe particulars, little or nothidp! rrow ar ore fiom this fourcc. juR oppofite, on the other Gde of &amp;c river4 is Gtuattted the village of Md. abba, once populous, and of itf revenue (alfo about 75 rupees) half went to the eitabliihment ,of Gangotrf, ar,d.half to the catching and training of hawks for the rtjtdss arnufemenr. -Now, the pandd and his family alone, conliflrng af' about r j perlons,.remain of its whole -popu- lation. The village oi Gzchaura sl lr, trll lately, produced r revenue to the crown of 75 rupees, but.nov ir is quite delolate 3 and this total de- fertion or partial deteriorati~g ,is u~iverfal~in the country.

Now the mindms have totally dercrtcd it, and only the name reinains. There can be but kt- tle doubt, that this defalcation in cultivation, ix~ habitants and generd profperity, mayr be referred . . to the imn- rule of the Gurc*&amp;,Cop guerorso WJ~. we .reached the village, no wale iahabitants ypre to be .&amp;n, 1 v: a few old brahm*nr and dccrerlirl olJ men, ,who, with the .women ad cnrldren# remained ia the houks. lu mfwer to our cnq~i. ry, as to where ttbe othen were--we were red.1~ and unheGtatiogly an. 4 fwered, that they had gone to buy corn. or to Rcal hccp ;''and in 8 tone, thrt proved they thought this a piece of hrimcls. too orclnary .md common so conceal.

Within a gun (hot of Ganbotrf, the Cidir Ganga a rapid and confiderable Bream, faid to have its rire in the Ciddr mountain i 2 cos dinant, debouches into the Bhdgi- rot'lri, and the place of confluence called Gaurf Cunda is 'holy, add le~es as a fqther prepgratorp oblution 'ere <span class="loc">Gangotri</span> be approached.

JuR above the debouche of the Cidb Conga, the bed widens into a hall [hringly fiacc, in which the river rolls with great rapidity, changing its courfc as the floods direct it.

Here, as at Jarnnotri, we were told, that no mortal ha, can go fur- r rhcr in its bed towards its iource, than this fpst", ad this difficulty is indeed fufficiently apparent. 'I made a' trial to gain a point about twelve furlongs off, beyond the temple, for the purpofe of obf'ing *the courfe of the river, and of leeing Gungotri ixi another point of view ; -but having, with confiderabla diffic&amp;yy mr&amp; ray way for fome dif- -tame over the anfleadg fragments, at the ri&amp; d being precipitated into the Rrearn, I was forced to turn back ; beyond that point, the y recipices.defcend more abruptly to fht watci's edge.: and, in all prw %ability, it -would be nearly impofible M make my along their faces. Crofing the ftream, to take advantage of ;the eafier places that may oc- fur oa either fide, is out of the queltion : it is too iarge and wid ;- and climbing higher up the mountain fide is equally fo, for the crags increafein ruggedncfs and kepnefs till they end in .tiow. It may be, that enterprifing perbns remaining at chis' fpot fdr kved days Pt weeks, might e~plore or form a path towards the foarp, for time and patient perfeverance can do much, and has in fa&amp; formed the pqh hither ; but I am convinced net only of the diacdty of. the kbrsg it- felf, but that it would not be eafy to overcome the relnaancc of tbc hill people to arcend, whofe affifiadc would be Zo neoeffary 10 kin- , gers, and whom Kuperfiition and religious prejdke ha* hkbcrm .- kept below. 1 bg , , '? .'T - .

In the one we were about to enter on, we were in- formed that, confiderable ohflacles would prefeot themrelves from the rile of one or two laqe nullahs, the temporary bridges of which had been carried awly by the floods. Direttions were given to ere&amp; others , for our pa(Tage, but the indolence and natural flownefs of thefe peo- ple, in the common bufineh of life, is fo great, that we coald place lit- tle reliance on their exertions, and we let off without any certainty of reaching <span class="loc">Barahit</span> that night. THE manufaQures of B'hcr are remarkably iuperior to thofe d Rewaen and Tamaur both in material and workmankip; the blankets and woollen fluffs of the former, arc frequently of great finenefs, clofc in texture and of confiderable beauty, while thok of the latter arc coarfe, unGghtly and bad ; the wool of the former, is of a fineneh equal to lome of our beit En-$ilh WCC~~~ while the produce of the' latter cou::trier appeals to partake of the charaAer of hair, and the thread fpun from it is brifily flubborn, and rather calculated to produce a coarf:: hair clo:h, that] any comfortable warm woollen fabrick; the reaibn of this difference, is even lefs explicable than that of others, and it is to be feared has its origin only in natural indolence and floth. For paflure at all events is equally good in Rewacn as in Bzjhtr, and one breed of iheep would in all probability thrive there as well as ;mQther, Eceing that they iucceed perfew well in a Gmilar climate.

THE circumffances in which thCb countties 'or diRriQs are placed, +though they appear to be pretty iirnilar, differ perhaps in fome points ; and it is but fair to <span class="loc">Itate</span> them, as it is psffible the difference of charaaer, above remarked, may in rome degree at iealt bc refcrrtd to them. Tw a <span class="loc">Gorc</span>'h have ruled in Grrwhlil for near twelve years, previous to which a' revere contefi had been maintained, which drained the coun- try of men and money. They appear to have borne in mind, in their iubfequent condua to this unfortunate State, the trouble it con them to win it, and aaed as if determined to revenge it. f ts ola families were defiroyed ; all thofe perfons of rank and importance who were taken, were murdercd,or banifhed ; its villages burnt or defirayed ; and great inumbers of its inhabitants were fold as naves. 'The remaining part were opprefied by heavy taxes: and many voluntary banilhments and -emigrations took place, to avoid a tyranny too opprefive to be borne, ' and too powerful to be withltood. Thus, throughout great part of :Gerwha'l, the traveller fees but the ruins of villages, and the-traces of -former cultivation now abandoned,: while$ the inhabitants that remain, are, in a11 probability, the moR ignorent and the lowefi ; and it may fairly be prefumed, have funk lower ,in exertion and mind, from the oppreflion they have groaned under.
