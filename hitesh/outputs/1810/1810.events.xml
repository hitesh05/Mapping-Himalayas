    THE information of which geographers are hitherto in possession regarding the source or sources of the Ganges, being uncertain and unsatisfactory, the su- preme government of Bengal determined, in 1807, to authorize a survey of the course of that river, up to its fountain, or as far as might be practicable ; and Lieut. Col. COLEBROOKE, the surveyor general, then employed on a survey of the newly acquired pro- vinces, was directed to execute this commjssion. .Col, COLEBROOK'S long and extensive experience, together with- the ardent zeal which he had always displayed for the advancement of geographical know- ledge, qualified him eminently for this task ; but he was rendered unable to proceed by the fatal malady which terminated his useful and meritorious labouw.

This road has been newly made by the Gurc'hdlie; and considerable labour has been be- stowed, in bringing .it even to its present passable state. In a quarter of an hour we came upon the bed of the river, covered with large stones, whence we reascended on the bank, and proceeding, over a very indifferent road, for fifteen minutes more,, we arrived at a fl.ight of steps, raised on a Ci~abutra, to the height of thirty feet. In the centre of it was a broad ladder, fihy or sixty feet long, resting on a projecting point of rock. The'materials were strong and good ; but the crowds of people, who were pass- ing up and down, made the scaffolding shake ; and some of the rounds having given way, rendered the passage more difficult. - The roaring noise of the water, together with' the buzz and tumult of the crowd, added not a little to the unpleasantness of the situation ; and the progress upwards was so slow, that a person had full leisure to attend to the sug- gestions of danger, which a rocky precipice of ninety or a hundred feet, would naturally create, under such circumstances. Havi~lg reached the ledge, which was in some places not above-a foot in breadth, we continued a short ascent, by steps, whence we be- gan to descend; and, in 'ten minutes, regained the # regular path on the slope. These are called the Cldri Dlhar and Canda Dha~ GVdts, well known to all travellers on this road. We had heard accounts of them several days before our arrival, and were prepared to encounter their difficul: ties, At 10-40 A.

Hence we proceeded, over large stones, near the bed of the river, and, in a few minutes, came opposite to a stream, calIed the Bunctr hTadi, which fqlls into the Alacanandd from the S. E.

The road of to-day is considered, and justly so, the worst between Srinagar and Blhadri-Nht'h. Al- though great pains have been taken to render it pas- sable, it is still in need of much improvement ; and there are some parts of it, which few people, unac- customed to such passages, could traverse, without feeling some sensation of apprehension. The hills, in general, bore a very barren appearance ; the lower ridges, which were sheltered f~om the winds, were partially covered-with verdure and small trees; while the higher ones produced only a few clumps of the weeping fir.

The breadth of the current is here considerably: de- creased, n~t exceeding eighteen or tweo . feet ; the stream ehallow, and moderately rapid. X t the dis- . tance of four furlongs, we crossed- the river, over a . bed of snow, and mounted on the opposite bank, whence we descended into another valley, in which we continued our route, for two or three miles, pass- ing over several deep beds of snow, collected in the ' cavities of vater courses and .ravines.

When the suhce of the moun- I tains was paaially disclosed, the soil was of a hard solid.rock ; and excepting at the base, not a vestige of verdure or vegetation was to be.eeen. The breadth- of the valley is about five or six hundred yards ; a 'imall space of it is laid ont in field, but the sides of the mountains are too steep and abrupt to carry .the cultivation beyond fie low ground, and are ac- ceesible only to the sheep and goats, that are seen browzing, a short distance up the 'slope, At twelve oJclocki we reached the extremity of our journey,. opposite to a water-fall called Bars4 Dhctpd.

The small quantity that dissolves, undermines the bed; whence it is- 'sues, in a small stream, about two hundrec! paces - below. This place forms the boundary of the pil- grilh's devotions ; some few come hither for the pur- pose'of being sprinkled by this holy shower bath. From this spot, the direction of the Alucanandd is perceptible to the S. W. extremity of the valley, distant about one mile; but its current is entirely concealed, under immense heaps of snow, which have, most probably been accumulating for ages, in its channel. Beyond this point, travellers have not dared to venture; and, although the Sdstras mention a place called Alacapzira,* whence the river derives its source and name, the position or existence of it is as' much obscured in doubt and fable, as every other part , - of their mythological history. Having now attained the limits prescribed for Lieu t. WERE' s inquiries in this direction, we com- menced our return, and proceeded by the road which leads to the town of Mdndb. In an hour and a half we arrived at Caldpa OrLn, the beauties of which were not perceptible from the opposite side of the river. From the summit of this hill, a large stream, called the Sarasloati Nadl, appears to force a passage, through a rocky cavern ; whence it descends, 'with irresistible violence, in a solid compact body, dis-' closed to the height of forty or fifty feet. The breadth of the cavity may be twenty-five or thirty feet ; and some large fragments, that have been thrown down by the earthquake, are collected, and wedged in to- * Alacci is the fabulous city of CUVERA, the PLUTUS of Hindti my- thol~gy.

At the bottom is a deep bason, or reservoir, composed of rock, rendered perfectly smooth by the action of the water. From hence, the stream flows in a gentle current, between two per- pendicular rocky banks, about seventy or eighty feet in height, and twenty feet in width. The water is perfectly clear, of a beautiful ultramarine colour ; which it retains for a considerable distance, after its union with the. Alacanundd, about seven hundred yards below, and forms a sin ular contrast with the. !r turbid water of that stream. he point of junction is called Cadprctydgd. The passage over the Suras- quati is by a bridge, formed of one entire piece of - rock, about six feet in thickness, ten or twelve in breadth, and so exactly fitted to the width of the stream, as to have.the appearance of being placed by the hands of mechanism ; and, notwithstanding the assertions of our guides, we could hardly believe its . positipn to have been accidental. Thi~~place goes by the name of Manstila Htd. Hence we ascended the bank leading to the town, situated a little above the confluence of the two streams. On the left of the road, are twd or three rocks, in the cavities of which small temples are erected. Of these, the. Gandsa Aaatcir is the most conspicuous, more from . its position than from the structure of the temple, which is about five feet high, and built of- square stones, piled one above the other, decreasing towards- the top. I.t stands in a large cavern, close to which a small stream comes rippling from the mountain. i The town of MdnaR is built in three divisions, containing one hundred and fifty or two hundred houses, and is more populous than any place we have met with of the same extent.

As soon as we entered the taws all the inhabit- ants came out, to welcome us ; and we obsetved a greater display of female and juvenile beauty,' than we recollect to have seen in any Indian village.

On. their heads they wore a round cap, with flaps, turned ' up behind and in front, with a cloth edging of a dif- . ferent colour.

In a quarter of an hour we came upon the bed of the river, covered with large stones, whence we reascended on the bank, and proceeding, over a very indifferent road, for fifteen minutes more,, we arrived at a fl.ight of steps, raised on a Ci~abutra, to the height of thirty feet. In the centre of it was a broad ladder, fihy or sixty feet long, resting on a projecting point of rock. The'materials were strong and good ; but the crowds of people, who were pass- ing up and down, made the scaffolding shake ; and some of the rounds having given way, rendered the passage more difficult. - The roaring noise of the water, together with' the buzz and tumult of the crowd, added not a little to the unpleasantness of the situation ; and the progress upwards was so slow, that a person had full leisure to attend to the sug- gestions of danger, which a rocky precipice of ninety or a hundred feet, would naturally create, under such circumstances. Havi~lg reached the ledge, which was in some places not above-a foot in breadth, we continued a short ascent, by steps, whence we be- gan to descend; and, in 'ten minutes, regained the # regular path on the slope.

    Hence we ascended, for ten minutes, and proceeded'alon theplope, at a greater or less elevation, till 10 A. % . when there was a ' (steep descent, for eight minutes, which brought us to a path, cut in the solid rock.

Although formidable in appearance, the path was tolerably se- cure ; and, by all accounts, infinitely preferable to the one'formerly pursued, which was higher up the mountain. This road has been newly made by the Gurc'hdlie; and considerable labour has been be- stowed, in bringing .it even to its present passable state. In a quarter of an hour we came upon the bed of the river, covered with large stones, whence we reascended on the bank, and proceeding, over a very indifferent road, for fifteen minutes more,, we arrived at a fl.ight of steps, raised on a Ci~abutra, to the height of thirty feet. In the centre of it was a broad ladder, fihy or sixty feet long, resting on a projecting point of rock. The'materials were strong and good ; but the crowds of people, who were pass- ing up and down, made the scaffolding shake ; and some of the rounds having given way, rendered the passage more difficult. - The roaring noise of the water, together with' the buzz and tumult of the crowd, added not a little to the unpleasantness of the situation ; and the progress upwards was so slow, that a person had full leisure to attend to the sug- gestions of danger, which a rocky precipice of ninety or a hundred feet, would naturally create, under such circumstances. Havi~lg reached the ledge, which was in some places not above-a foot in breadth, we continued a short ascent, by steps, whence we be- gan to descend; and, in 'ten minutes, regained the # regular path on the slope. These are called the Cldri Dlhar and Canda Dha~ GVdts, well known to all travellers on this road. We had heard accounts of them several days before our arrival, and were prepared to encounter their difficul: ties, At 10-40 A. M. we halted for seven minutes, opposite to the Cl'ibaad Ncidi, which falls into the 'Akucanandci on the other side. From hence the road continued, along the .slope, rendered very bad, in SURVEY. OF THE GANGES. 59 1 some places, by intervening banks of rock. About eteven o'clock, the rain began to fall, in a drizzling shower, and as it continued to increase, we halted, . for half an hour, in a small cave by the side. of the road. After pursuing our route, we arrived, in fif- teen minutes, at a small village called Hdt'. Hence we proceeded, over large stones, near the bed of the river, and, in a few minutes, came opposite to a stream, calIed the Bunctr hTadi, which fqlls into the Alacanandd from the S. E. Immediately above the junction, is a Sangha, supported on two large frag- ments of rock, about five or six feet above the water. At one o'clock, the rain descended. in a heavy . shower, which continued, with litttle intermission, till the evening. The road of to-day is considered, and justly so, the worst between Srinagar and Blhadri-Nht'h. Al- though great pains have been taken to render it pas- sable, it is still in need of much improvement ; and there are some parts of it, which few people, unac- customed to such passages, could traverse, without feeling some sensation of apprehension. The hills, in general, bore a very barren appearance ; the lower ridges, which were sheltered f~om the winds, were partially covered-with verdure and small trees; while the higher ones produced only a few clumps of the weeping fir. The tops of the mouiitains, to the N. about five or six miles distant, were completely co- vered with snow. For these three days past,&gt;the change in the weather has been very'perceptible ; as we approached the hoary peaks, we found our warm cloathing absolutely necessary. 29th. Therrh. 59.

W. bounds the valley in its N. E. direction. The hill is composed of rock, and covered with large loose fragments; which seem to threaten destruction to the .houses placed at the foot of it. It is called Caldpa Grdm; and, as.evy rock in thismeighbour- hood is'sanctified.by some' holy tradition, this place is distinguished as the residence of SurycGVad and Chndrcp-Vad, the patriarchs of .the two races of Ra&amp;iEts. From hence we proceeded don the banks of the AImd, in the direction of 1 V. N. W. The breadth of the current is here considerably: de- creased, n~t exceeding eighteen or tweo . feet ; the stream ehallow, and moderately rapid. X t the dis- . tance of four furlongs, we crossed- the river, over a . bed of snow, and mounted on the opposite bank, whence we descended into another valley, in which we continued our route, for two or three miles, pass- ing over several deep beds of snow, collected in the ' cavities of vater courses and .ravines. The north faces of themountains, to the south of the river, were completely covered with snow, from the summit to the b'ase ; and the bleak aspect of the country, with .the sharp piercing wind, gave the appearance .and sensation of the depth .of winter, in a myth. more northern latitude. When the suhce of the moun- I tains was paaially disclosed, the soil was of a hard solid.rock ; and excepting at the base, not a vestige of verdure or vegetation was to be.eeen. The breadth- of the valley is about five or six hundred yards ; a 'imall space of it is laid ont in field, but the sides of the mountains are too steep and abrupt to carry .the cultivation beyond fie low ground, and are ac- ceesible only to the sheep and goats, that are seen browzing, a short distance up the 'slope, At twelve oJclocki we reached the extremity of our journey,. opposite to a water-fall called Bars4 Dhctpd.

' the river; and falls from the summit, upon a projecting ledge, about two hundred feet high, where it divides into two streams, which descend in drifting showers of spray, upon a bed of snow, where the particles im- mediately become congealed. The small quantity that dissolves, undermines the bed; whence it is- 'sues, in a small stream, about two hundrec! paces - below. This place forms the boundary of the pil- grilh's devotions ; some few come hither for the pur- pose'of being sprinkled by this holy shower bath. From this spot, the direction of the Alucanandd is perceptible to the S. W. extremity of the valley, distant about one mile; but its current is entirely concealed, under immense heaps of snow, which have, most probably been accumulating for ages, in its channel. Beyond this point, travellers have not dared to venture; and, although the Sdstras mention a place called Alacapzira,* whence the river derives its source and name, the position or existence of it is as' much obscured in doubt and fable, as every other part , - of their mythological history. Having now attained the limits prescribed for Lieu t. WERE' s inquiries in this direction, we com- menced our return, and proceeded by the road which leads to the town of Mdndb. In an hour and a half we arrived at Caldpa OrLn, the beauties of which were not perceptible from the opposite side of the river. From the summit of this hill, a large stream, called the Sarasloati Nadl, appears to force a passage, through a rocky cavern ; whence it descends, 'with irresistible violence, in a solid compact body, dis-' closed to the height of forty or fifty feet.
