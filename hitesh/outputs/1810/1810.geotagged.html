<p>NARRATIVE OF A SURVEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING I THE SOURCES OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. - BY CAPT. F. V. RAPER. COMMUNICATED BY THE PBESIDEXT. THE information of which geographers are hitherto in possession regarding the source or sources of the <span class="loc">Ganges</span>, being uncertain and unsatisfactory, the su- preme government of <span class="loc">Bengal</span> determined, in 1807, to authorize a survey of the course of that river, up to its fountain, or as far as might be practicable ; and Lieut. Col. COLEBROOKE, the surveyor general, then employed on a survey of the newly acquired pro- vinces, was directed to execute this commjssion. .Col, COLEBROOK'S long and extensive experience, together with- the ardent zeal which he had always displayed for the advancement of geographical know- ledge, qualified him eminently for this task ; but he was rendered unable to proceed by the fatal malady which terminated his useful and meritorious labouw. At his recommendation, Lieutenant WEBB was no- SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 447 minated to continue the enterprize, for the :conduct of which he had instructions to the following .effect. 1. ' To survey the ~o&amp;es, from ~aridtudr'to Gan- gotri, where that river is supposed either to force its I way, byasubterraneous passage, through the Hir~triZuyo , mountains, or to fall over their brow, in the form of v a cascade. To ascertain the dimensions of the fall, and delineate its appearance, and to observe its true geographical situation in latitude and longitude. 2. To ascertain whether this be thk ultimate I 3ource of the <span class="loc">Ganges</span>; and in case it should prove otherwise, to trace the river, by survey, as far to- 1- ., wards its genuine source as possible. To learn, in 1 particular, whether, as stated by Major RENNELL, it arises from the lake Manasurobar; and, should evi- l dence be obtained confirming his account, to get, as !. nearly ae practicable, the bearing and distance of that /I lake. 1. 3. ' To fix, as well as it can be done, by bearings 1 of the snowy mountains, and by the reports of the natives, (should the time not admit of a more parti- / cular survey,) the positions of the sources of the : Alucanandai river at Bhadhncitha, and of the Ckdd~ ' river, which joins it above 'Srinagara, at Ckddr-. , ndt'l~n. One or both of the peaks, under which these rivers rise, are stated by Col. HARDWICKE to be ( visible'frorn places near 'Srinagaro; and consequently \ their situation may probably be ascertained by bear- ings taken at 'different stations on the road to Gan- I: pt2.i. 1 4. ' To inquire how far the source of the Yamd river lies to the west or north-west of Gangotrl; and, if any particular mountain be pointed out as the place where it rises, to fix the position of that mountain by -bearings. % $6 SURVE~ bb TI;IZ G.Ah'GES. 5.

' The situations of all tpwns, forts, places of, Hindrc worship, 1)haratasrELus or resting places, will \ be included, and hn accurate delineation made of the road, and of' every remarkable or interesting object which is visible from it. 7. ' The height of .the barometer (should such qn instrument be obtainetl in time*) is to be observed at every halting place;. for the purpose of being com- .bined with trigonometrical calculation$, in ascertain- ing theheights of the.principa1 mountains in the Hi- ~r~cihya :sr snowy range. 8. It would be desirable that Lieut. WEBB, after completing the survey from Haridwdr, by Srinagar or Dkvapydga to Gangotrl, should return, if prac- ticable, by a different and more easterly. route, through <span class="loc">Almora</span> to Burdii.' Lieut. WEBB wzs accompanied on hip tour by Captain RAPER of the Honourable Company's ser- vice, and Captain HEARSAY formerly .in that of MADHAJI SX'NDHIAH. .It uras'proposed thst Mr. WEBB shou,ld commence his 'journey, as- soon as might be practicable after the conclusion of the fair at Haridwdr, which takes plax *annually at the vernal gainox. It was expected, that !by'this'time, the necessaryarders wouldbe circulated, etb'the different Actmids of the <span class="loc">Nepal</span> <span class="loc">Raja</span>, to ensure !a -- .. !bafe passage Chroogh ,the Gurc'kali territories. - "TWO mountain barometers were afterwards dispatched from <span class="loc">Calcutta</span>, but unfortunately both were broken on the way. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GAIL</span>'GES. 4 $9 The party arrived, on the first of April I SO&amp; at Haridwdra, and encamped at the village of Canac'-. IIcL~, (Kankk~al) on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Ganges</span>, ats tbe distance of about two miles from the fair, and on the left of the detachment which had been assembled for the purpose of maintaining tranquillity on that occasion. The bathing place, called Hara-ca-Pairi, situated at the northern extremity of Haridwdra, is 24 miles from Canac'hala, and the road lies through a wood, on the banks of the river. The town of Haridwcira is very inconsiderable in itself, having only one street about 15 feet in breadth, and one furlong ahd a half in length. It is situated in lat. 29 57 9 N. and in long. 78 8 80 E. as ascer- tained by Mr. REUBEN BURROW, and corresponds, in its relative situation, with the observations made by Lient. WEBB, from our camp near <span class="loc">Canuc</span>'hak, the latitude of which he made (29 56 7 N. The Hara-cu-Pakri (or foot of H ARA) is the Ghdt where the ablutions are performed ; and the temple dedicated to this deity, rises from the bed of the river at the base of the hill. It is a plain building, sur- mounted by two cupolas, one of which contains the image of the divinity. The customs and manners of the Hindus are so blended with their religious ceremonies, and their my- thobgy is such a compound of allegory and fable, that it is hardly possible to ascertain the origin of their sacred institutions ; we can therefore only relate tra- ditions, leaving the explanation to those who are more conversant with the subject. This place derives its name from <span class="loc">HABA</span>, whichis synonymouswith <span class="loc">MAHA</span>- <span class="loc">Vor</span>,. XI. C; Q 450 . SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. DEV A, and Dlucircc a door or passage *. The Gunges, after forcine; its way through an extensive tract of mountainous country, here first enters on the plains ; and the veneration which the Hindus have for this river, woi~ld naturally point out this as a place deserv- ing of peculiar worship. At the commencement of the hot weather, an annual pilgrimage is enjoined, and attended by people from all parts of Hirldlcsta?~ and the Dekl~in, for the purpose of iliaking their ab- lutions in the holy stream. The bathing commences in the month of Chaitra, when the sun is in Mina or Pisces, and concludes on the day he enters Mdsha or <span class="loc">Aries</span>, agreeably to the solar computation of the Hindus, and corresponding with the loth April, on which day the sun has actually advanced 20'1 in that simn. Evcry twelfth year is celebrated with greater b rejoicings, and is called the CCmtiha -Wt!Za, so denot- ed from the planet <span class="loc">Jupiter</span> bring then in the sign of Aq~~arirts. Whether this sign be symbolical of the purpose for which they meet, or whether the injunc- tion be arbitrary or accidental, is not ascertained ; but a pilgrimage at these duodecennial periods is consider-. ed the most fortunate andefficacious. The presentwas . one of those periods ; being just twelve years since the visit of Col. HARDWIZKE to the fair, when the conten- tions, which took place between the different sects of religious mendicants, were attended with considerable bloodshed, as related in the sixth volume of Asiatic Researches. To prevent a repetition of such outrages, the detachment assembled for the preservation of peace was this year of greater strength than usual. The fair is totally unconnected with the ostensible purport of the meeting; but the Hitzdi~ never lases sight of his worldly interests, and a ikfdZu is a neces- sary consequence of their religious convocations ; * Harudwdra, also called Gnnjiddwcira. It is written Haridwa'ra in the Cbddrac'hundn of the Scandd Purdna, and other Purcinas. This marks a diffaent etymology; from <span class="loc">Hari</span>, VIGHNU, not from <span class="loc">Hara</span>, <span class="loc">MAHADEVA</span>. Note by the Prcsidcnt. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 45 1 numbers are led hither as much from commmc.ia1 as holy motives, and independant of the merchandize' brought by the merchants from the Penjdb, Cdbul, Cushmir and other places, most of the pilgrims supply themselves with some articles, the produce or manu- facture of the country from which they came, for which they are certain of an advantageous sale; through thischannel the principal citiesin the Duciba, Delhi and Lukhnau are supplied with the productions of the western and northern countries. To facilitate these commercial transactions, which are carried on to an immense extent, yents are deputed from the most respectable bankers, who exchange money, and grant bills, to all parts oflndia, to any amount. This kind of negociation must be extremely profitable, as a high premium is levied on the <span class="loc">Hund</span>'i*, and the produce of the sales is generally remitted in this man- ner ; few articles from the Company's or Vizier's provinces being disposed of in the way ofbarter. . Al- though a very considerable traffic be carried on at this. season, it does not strike aperson with that idea. One great disadvantage, however, is the bad accommoda- tion for the merchants, who are obliged to stow their goods into all the vacant holes and corners, where they are not exposed to public view, and which are so con- fined as not to admit of the,bales being unpacked. A person, therefore, who may be desirous of examin- ing and ascertaining what articles may have been brought for sale, is obliged to make his way, with qreat difficulty, through an immense crowd; and after hunting- in vain, through narrow, dark and noisome passages, he at length relinquishes the attempt in disgu%t. The inconvenience might be obviated, without much expense, by building a commodious street, with shops on each side ; which, by being let out at a reasonable price, during the fair, would soon repay the original cost. The protection afforded to ~ -- * Bill of exchange. GG2 459 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. the merchant, added to the convenience this arranse- ment would produce, might be the means of bringlng a greater variety of foreign productions through this channel. As' very great amendments have already been made in the roads, tending much to the comfort of the passengers, and have excited their high com- mendations and thanks, we may perhaps in time see these improvements also carried into effect. The principal articles brought hither for sale, are horses, mules, camels, a species of tobacco (called Caccar,) antimony, asafetida, dried fruits, such ae apricots, figs, prunes, raisins, almonds, pistachio nuts and pomegranates, from Cdbul, Candahdr, Multdn, and the PenjGb ; shawls, Daitas, Path, from Cashmir and A~nritsar; Chirds,(orspotted turbans,) looking-glasses, toys, with various manufactures in brms and ivory, froin Ja,yaphra ; shields, from Roililkhand, <span class="loc">Lakhnau</span> ' and Sz'lhet ; bows and arrows, from Multdn and the Dudb ; rock salt from <span class="loc">Lahor</span> ; baftsrl and piece goods, from Rabn, a large city in the Penjdb. Tbe couptry of Mciwcir also supplies a great number of camels, and a species of flannel called <span class="loc">Loi</span>. From the com- pany's provinces are brought kharua, rnuslias, rnashric (or sarcenet,) cocoa-nuts and woollen cloths. Of the lqtter, a few bales are sent on the part of the company ; but the sale of them is very inconsiderable, and the coarsest only-meet with a ready market. The northern merchants who visit the fair, travel in large parties called Ca&amp;YaRs ; and the cattle brought for sale are used also for the conveyance of merchan- dize. Those who have no investments of shawls or dried fruits, accommodate pilgritns, and other travel- , lers, from whom they receive more than sufficient to &amp;fray the expenses of the animals on the road. We inquired what might be the price of a seat on a camel, and were informed, by a man who had travel- led in that manner, that he had paid nine rupees from Mdrzacir to HaridwJqp. The machine, in which SURVEY OF TIXI? GANGES. 453 the goods and passengers are stowed, is a kind of wooden pannier, about three feet long and two feet broad, with a low railing all round, and the bottom laced with cords. One of these is suspended on each side the camel, and each pannier aecomnrodates two passengers. The CdtJiluhs generally assemble at Am- ritsar, abut the end of February, and pursue their route through the <span class="loc">Sik</span>'h country. At that place, and at the principal cities in the Penjdb, duties are levied, not ohly on the merchandize, but on the tra- vellers, at zi Rxed price per head ; and they complain mach of the interruption they meet with from the numerous banditti, *ho hover about for plunder. These freebooters are always mounted, and go in parties of twenty or thirty together ; and although the Cctfidahs are suficiently strong to keep them at a dis- tance, they often succeed in carrying away some of the stragglers. After crossing the htltj, they proceed in secirri ty to Haridtodva, and the road from Sehdranpzir is a continued Iine of travellers, from the middle of March till the coklcIusion of the fair. This is the most frequented track ; although, to- ' wards the end of the festival, every avenue is closed, by the swarms tvhich pour in from all quarters. Those who come merely for the purpose of bathing, arrive in the morhing ; and, aRer performing their ablutions, depart in the evening, or on the following day; by which meam a constant succession ofstrangers is kept up t occasioning one of the most bu5y scenes that can be well conc'eivec?. To calculate the probable amount of such multitudes would be impossible, and it would be equally vain to hazard a conjecture ; but if we es- timate the number at two millions of souls, we shall probab#y fall short rather than exceed the reality. Du~ing the Ma7tarata government, there *re some grounds on which the cslculation might have been GO 3 454 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. made ; as a kind of poll-tax was Ievied on those who came to the fair, and very heavy duties on cattle and merchandise ; but this arbitrary system is now abo- lished, andall castsand descriptions of people have fiee ingress and egress, without impost or molestation. To subsist such hosts of people, would, one might suppose, almost create a -famine ; but the Bazar ex- hibi ted no appearance of scarcity, and flour sqld in our camp at the rate of twenty-four or twenty-five skrs for the rupee. The ephemeral visitors, in general, bring their own provisions ; and some thousands of carts are employed in conveying grain to the fair. These supplies are drawn chiefly from the Dudb ; and, to judge by the appearance 06 the crops in that quarter, subsistence might have been yielded to twice the number ; for the whole country was-a perfect picture of affluence and plenty. Besides the articlesabove mentioned, wewere much surprised to see some Venetian and Dutch coins, and some toys of Ez~ropean manufacture, exposed for sale in the market ; by what route the latter found their way to <span class="loc">India</span>, it is difficult to say, but most probably by Swat. The horses and cattle are dispersed, indiscriminate- ly, all over the fair, which is held in the bed of the river, at this season nearly dry. After the first of April, the influx of people is so great, that few vacant spots are to be found in the vicinity of the market ; and encroachments sre made on the neighbou~ing mountain ; huts and. temporary habitations are ob- served to rise in every direction ; and, from a barren deserted bed of sand, the' whole surface is seen in mo- tion. It is curiou~ to observe the different cast of countenance, of the various tribes who are here as- sembled 8 and the contrast of tharacter would furnish an excellent subject for the pencil of an HOG <span class="loc">ARTH</span>. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. $55 . The most conspicuous personages are the Fakirs, of whom there are several sects ; but the principal ones are the Gosuins or Sannyasis, the Buiraigs, the Jhgis and the Udaisis. The four sects are again sub-divided, and branch out in to a great variety ; the different - shades and discriminations of which it is difficult to make out, or comprehend. The most numerous are the Gosains, who, during the Mahuruta government, were sufficiently powerful to dispute the authority at the place ; and not only collected the duties, on their own account ; but regulated the police during the fair. This assumption was, of course, productive of many . serious disfiutes, which were decided by the sword : -but the Gosains were generally victorious, and main- tained the sovereignty for many years. The next * ppwerful sect was the Bairagi; but, from the year 1760, till the company got possession of the Dutib, this cast was debarred ,from the pilgrimage. The ' .cause of this exclusion proceqded fion~ two brothers, D'HOCAL G~R and DAYARA.'~ PAT'HA, who having determined on a life of penance, the former enlisted himself under tb&amp; banners of the Gosuins, and the latter of the Bairdgis. In the Cwmbh-mkla of that , year, they both happened to meet at Haridwcira, and mutual recriminations took place, regarding the tenets which they had individually embraced. From a private, it became a general cause ; and it was agreed, that the sword should prove the superiority. On the Phrbi or last day of bathing, the two parties met, near Canac'hala, and after a long and bIoody contest, victory declared in favour of the Gosains. It is said that eighteen thousand Baircigis were left dead orithe Geld. Since that time, the Gosains have claimed the pre-eminence, and appear to have exercised their au- thority in a manner little expressive of meekness or 'toleration. Although their despotic sway is over, 'they still occupy the best situations at the fair ; the whole of the road between <span class="loc">Canuc</span>'halu and Huridtucira being inhabited by this sect. Considerable expense GG'b 456 SUBV'EY PB THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. must have been incurred by many of them, to render their temporary habitations comfortable and con- venient. On the ridge of the bank, on each side of the road, grass huts and small Bangalah are erected, in front of which are high Chabut~as, in imitation of forts and bastions, with embrasures, kc. On these they repose, with all the prh of conscious superiority and independence. Many of them profess a total dis- ~egard for all worldly concerns, and appear complete- ly in a state d nature. Among these Goaaim are many hen of considerable property, who assume only the garments of the devo- tee, being in other respects well provided with all! the comforts and conveniencies of life ; some of them fd- low a military profession, but the greater ntqnber are engaged in agricultural or commercial pur~uits, in which they acquire large fortunes. On occasions l&amp;e the present, they expend large sums, in charity, among the poorof their own sect, and in presents to the priests or Brahnzelas, who preside over the different places of sacred worship. One inode oE dispensing their ' charity is by stationinq people at different places on the road, to distribute water to the thirsty passengers ; and although the boon be small, it is very salutary, and there is always a constant succession of claimants and petitioners. The Gosains or Sannyasia are distingdshed by a sheet or wrapper of cloth, dyed with red ochre, and round the neck they wear a string of beads, called Ra- dracsha* ; this latter, however; is not confined to thia sect, as the Udasis and Jdgis make use of the Sam;. The Gosuins are the worshippers of Siv~. The Bairct- gis are the disciples of VISH N u, and are distinguished by two perpendicular stripes of yellow ochre, or sandal, It Seeds of the GaniPrus of RU~PHIUS: a species of Elcocarpw. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. , 457 on theforehead, andbyastringof Tulasi beads roundthe neck. The Ud&amp;s are the followers of N A'N nc, the founder of the Sikh sect; and address their prayers to the prophet, whom they term Guru. They are known by the conical cap with a fringe, which they wear on all solemn occasions. The Jdgis or Canp'hufar are the disciples of Siv~, as the Gosains; but, as the term Cdnp'hata implies, they have a lon- gitudinal slit in the cartilage of the ear, through which a ring, or piate of horn, wood or silver, about the size of a crown piece, is suspended. Another custom obtains among the Gosains and Jigis, which is uncommon among the other Hindus, that of bury- ing their dead. All these casts engqe in husbandry and commerce; but the profession of arms is pecu- liar to the Gosaim or Sannyasis: some of them never shave, but allow the hair on the head to grow to an enormous length, binding it round the fore- head in small tresses, like a turban. No paeicular ceremony is observed at the bathing, which consists qstirely in the simple immersion. Those who are rigidly pious, or may have any appre- hension in going into the water, are introduced by a couple of Brcihmens ; who, having dipped the pe- nitent in the holy stream, reconduct him to the shore. Few, however, require this assistzince ; and, as the water is not above four feet deep, the women even plung'e in without hesitation, and both sexes intermix indiscriminately. After the ablution is performed, the men whose fathers are dead, and wi- dews, undergo the operation of tonsure; and many of them strew the hair in some frequented path, with the superstitious idea that good or bad fortune is in- dicated by the person or animal that first chances to tread upon it. An elephant is considered peculiarly fortunate. Besides the War-ra-Pairi, t,here are several other 459 SURVEY OF THE GASGES. places of religious worship in the neighbourhood. . The PacA-Tirt'Au is a collective'name, given to five po~ls or basons of water, situated between two hills to the west of the town. The names of these are Amrit-Ctind, Tapta-Czind, Rdnqa-CCnd, Sttd-CGnd, and Suyu-CCnd. They all proceed from the same source, and appear to be beds formed in the rock by a water course, which lnay be traced to the summit of the hill. The Br&amp;nens wished to persuadq us, that these reservoirs were supplied by springs, issu- ing from the side of the rock; but there was no ap- . pearance to justify the assertion. ,The water is strongly impregnated with minerals, diffusing an of- fensive smell; and it was moreover extremely foul, by the agitation caused by the bathers. . . The next place deserving notice, is BhSma Ghdrci, situated to the N. W. of the town; and the road to it lies over the mountain contiguous to Har-ca- ~ Pairi. It is in a small recess of the mountain, which is a perpendicular solid rock, about three hundred and fifty feet in height.- ' It is said, that BH~MA was posted here, to prevent the river from taking a different course; and immediately above the bath, about twelve feet from the ground, is an artificial excavation in the rock, which they pretend was occasiofied by a kick from the horse on which BH~M A was mounted. The cave is about five feet square, and inhabited, during the fair, 'by a Fakir. I Ladders are planted for the convenience of the curious, who may be desirous of convincing them- 1 selves of the powers which' this horse was reported ' ~ to possess. The Ctind, or pool, is larger than thdse above-mentioned;' and, being in one of the small 'channels of the river, receives a constant though scanty supply. It is a commodious place for bath- ing, but not considered peculiarly holy by orthodox - Hindus. Opposite to Har-ctz-Paid is a high hill, called Chccn'dicci G'hu't't'a, on the top of which is a 1 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 4 59 small temple, with a trident. This we had not an opportunity of visiting, nor did we see Satya Czind, a sacred placea,lout half a mile to thewest of our camp. At the foot of the pass leading from Har-ca-Pciri, is n Gurc'hdi <span class="loc">Choki</span> or post, to which slaves are brought down from the hills, and exposed for sale. Many hundreds-of these poor wretches, of both sexes,. from three to thirty years of age, are annually dis- posed of in the way of traffic. Those slaves are brought down from all parts of ' the interior of the hills, and sold at Har.idwir, from ten to one hundred and fifty rupees. The show of cattle, this year, was very inferior to what might have been expected; and the great de- mand, both on the part of the Company and of indi- viduals, raised the prices very considerably. The average price of the camels from the Penjab was seventy-five rupees; and a common horse was not to be purchased under two hundred and fifty, or three hundred rupees. There were very few of the Persian or high northern breed ; the prevailing casts were the Turk?, and the cross breed of Furki and. Tdzi. A singular mode of conducting bargains obtains here; which, however, is not uncommon in other parts of <span class="loc">India</span>. The merchants never mention vivd voce;'the prices they have fixed on their cattle, but the agreement is carried on by the finger, and a cloth is thrown over the hands, to prevent the by- !tandem from gaining any information. The follow- Ing is the key to this secret language, which is very simple, though expressive. Each ficlger, under\the term of Ddnah, implies one rupee, of Dohrah Ddnah ,two rupees. Thus, by taking hold of three. of the merchant's fingers, and making use of the first, term, it 'would imply three, and of the second term six rupees. <span class="loc">Sut</span> or Sutili means twenty rupees, and each finger under that term, bears that value. So, or hundreds, are expressed in the same manner; and it is only necessary to give the term, to be clearly understood. Bargains are concluded in this manner with great readiness; and it is very rare that any mistake or misunderstanding occurs, between the purchaser and the vender. Those who are not conversant in this language, are obliged to employ Deddls or brokers, who are to be met with in all parts of the fair, and receive a per centage on the purchase; but, as they generally have an understanding with, and are in the interest of the merchants, very little &amp;pendance can be placed on the honesty of these agents. The Governor of Srinagar, HASTI D'HAL CHAUTRA, being arrived at Carcari, a small GUTC'- hdEi village, near Bhim-Ghbra; we paid him a visit on the 8th of April, and were kindly received. Our meeting. was under a large tree; his present ternpo- rary habitation being too small to receive us. He expatiated much on the difficulties of our under- taking, and the privations to which we should be subjected; but assured us of every assistance in his power, only lamentin , that as a new governor had been appointed from bePWl, he shotlld not be able to yield us such effectual aid, as he would have done, had the termination of his office been more remote. He promised, however, that if it depended on him, every thing should be ready for our depar- ture two or three days after the conclusion of the Fair. The Ch~utra is a man about forty-five or fop; ty-six years of age, of middle stature, and rather corpulent. His countenance is pleasing, and his manners very conciliatory: in his waist he wore a 1arg.e curved knife, with a plain ebony handle, the sheath mounted with gold. Most of the chiefs about him were armed with weapons of the same ahape, but mounted with silver. SURVEY OF TBE GANGES. 46 1 On the following morning, HASTI D'HAL re- turned our visit; and the subject of our journey was again resumed. In the course of conversation, he suggested, that the route to Ga~~gotri, by the way of Srinagar would be very circuitous, and could not be completed in less than a month and a half; whereas, by making Gangotrf our first object, we might return by Srbugar in one month. By this arrangement, we had the advantage of comprehend- ing the whole circle of the places we wished to visit, within the limits of a two month's tour, leaving us one month for the performance of the journey to Bhadri-adt'h. The Chawtra staid but a sbrt time; when he took his leave, we presented him with a few articles of European minufacture, with which he appeared highly gratified. The tenth of April, being the Purbf or last day of bathing, the crowds of people were immense; every avenue to the Ghat was completely choaked up; and the flight of steps, leading to the water, poured down from the top such a constant succession of fresh comers, that the lower tiers were ugable to resist the impetus, and were involuntarily hurried into the stream. The fair, however, concluded without any troubles or disturbance, to the great surprise and satisfaction of numbers, who were accustomed- to consider bloodshed and murder in- separable from the Cumb'ha Mdla; as, for many ages past, these duodecennial periods have been marked with some fatal catastrophe. A very salu- tary regulation was enforced by our police; prohi- *biting any weapons being worn or carried at the fair- Guards were posted, at the different avenues, to receive the arms of the passengers; a ticket was placed on each, and a corresponding one given to the owner; the arms were returned on the ticket being produced. 462 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. This arrangement had the desired effect; for the utmost tranquillity prevailed ; and from the content and satisfaction that were expressed, by all ranks of ' people, on this occasion, we may anticipate the praises that will be carried hence, to all parts of Hindostdn, on the mild system of the British go- vern men t. On the eleventh, we received a visit from HAST~ D'HAL, accompanied by BH AIRO TAP AH, his SUC- cessor in the government of Srinagar, on whom the arrangements for our journey were in future to de- pend. We found in this man great disinclination to forward our views. He at first endeavoured to deter us from the journey, by exaggerated representations of its difficulties; and afterwards threw various obsta- cles in theiway of our preparations. At last, how- ever, in conformity to the instructions of his govern- ment, though with evident reluctance, and at an exorbitant rate, he furnishedas many coolies and bear- ers, for the Ja~npuans or hill litters, as enabled us to proceed on the following day. Lieut. Webb took the height of BhimG'hirra, which he ascertained to be four hundred and seven feet. The following morning, we received the last visit of the benevolent HASTI D' H A L, whose removal from. office we had much cause to regret. He expressed his sorrow, that we should set off so ill provided with ' carriage, and that we had been detained so long. We parted, after giving mutual presents ; and he promised , , to meet us at Srinapr, and accompany us to Alnihra,* where his brother BH~M SA'A was governor. . At ten o'clock, our baggage ;nd tents were ready to move off, and we commenced our line of march. It was quite a n~velty, to see the Pahdris carrying SURVEY OP THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 463 their loads, which were contained in large baskets, called CandJ or Cand'lii. They are made of Bambii, about two and an half feet highi in the shape of a cone, and are slung to the shoulders, by means of a couple of strong loops, made of rope, or plaited grass, through which the arms are introduced. Each man is provid- ed with a cross stick, in the shape of the letter T, about three and an half feet high, which assists him in walking, and serves as a prop or rest for the bur- then, when he is inclined to take breath, without dis- engaging his load. Those articles which were too long or bulky to be packed in a <span class="loc">Candi</span>, were well se- cure'd with cords, and carried on the back in the same manner. The Jampudn is a small bedstead, about three feet in length and two in breadth : at each corner is a post which supports a canopy. The poles are about eight feet long, fixed on each side, with a trans- verse bar at the extremities ; in the center of which is a small pole or rest, by which the carriage is conveyed in the manner of a Tonjon. It is rather a confined and , inconvenient carriage at first; but the motion is ex- ' tremely easy. This machine is peculiarly adapted for a mountaimus country, as the weight remains always in equilibrio. . As soon as we struck our tents, the Cilamtra, with the troops stationed at <span class="loc">Canuc</span>'hala were put into mo- tion, and set off towards their respective destinations. Several companies of ,new levies from Nepcil were going to relieve a detachment ofshe Gurc'hali troops, which had been employed for two years and a half in blockading Chnwra, a strong hill fort belonging to Itljah s ANSAR-EHAND, without being able to rduce it to terms, or make any impression. Our road, for four miles two furlongs, run parallel with, and at a short distance from the river; when we proceeded in a N. W. direction, quitting the track of the pilgrims, who were going by the way of .Hrishicksu (Hrik'hikes) to Bhct- . dri-ncit'h and Ckdha-ncitYA. I 564 SURVEY OF TH~ GANGES. ~ At five o'clock, P. M. we encamped, having I marched twelve miles, in a north-west direction. I I We observed, on the road, severd fig zind white mulberry trees, with ripe fruit; and the wild fowls, peacocks, and black partridges* were calling in every direction. We saw &amp;me Obte or pits, for catching ele- phants, which are numerous, and very destructive to the crops in this valley. The species found here is small, and far inferior to those caught in other parts of Hindostdn. They seldom exceed seven feet in height, and are sold, when first caught, for two or three hun- dred rupees. Two days, in which we marched twenty miles,about ~ N. N. W. half W. brought us to Gurudwcira, an extea- sive village, of beautiful appearance, pleasantly si- tuated, and adorned with a handsome temple, erected by RAM-RAE, one of the followers of NANAC, the founder of the Skk'h religion. The priests are of the sect of Udcisis. During the Hhlz', an annual fair held here is numerously attended, by pilgrims fiom the PenjLb and countries to the westward. About half a mile to the north of the village, is the field of battle, which decided the contest be- tween the <span class="loc">Srinagar</span> and Gurc'hu rajahs; the former of whom was killed in the engagement, by a musket ball. The accounts of his death spread general consternation through the country; and the inhabi- tants, forsaking their villages, retired to the moun- tains, whence they could not be drawn by any threats or persuasions: The whole of this beautihl valley was laid open to pillage, and the following year remained uncultivated, when HAR-SE,WA C-RAM, the present Mehant, was reinstated in his posses- sions. Through his influence the peasants were SURVEY' OF THE GA~JGES. 465 induced .to return; and the country has, in some measure, recovered from this severe blow. April 16th. The weather being stormy, with rain, we halted, and received the visit of BH AIRO TAP AH, who appeared to evince a more friendly disposition than formerly; and as his route was now about to separate from ours, took measures, by registering our attendants, to guard against their desertion. He took his leave with.many expressions of friendship. We made hiin some trifling presents at parting, and separated, under the most flattering assurances of his good will, and desire to render us every assistance. 17th. Marched to Ndgal. . The first 'part of the road lay by the side of a beautiful little river, which turns four or five water mills, placed in the declivi- ties of its bed. 'This machine for grinding corn, is of very simple construction, and is in general use in this part of the country: It is composed of two large round stories, about eighteen inches in diameter and four in thickness. The under onc is fixed, and the upper one placed in a perpendicular axle', at the lower extremity of which eight or ton spokes are thrown out horizontally, On these the water is brought to des- cend, from a sufficient elevation to give the machine a quick rotatory motion. The banks of this-rivulet were lined with the wil- low and the raspberry bush; the fruit of which was ripe, of a deep yellow, with hardly flavour enough to call to recollection the fruit of <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Wheat and barley were produced in great abundance, in the val- lies, which possess a feftile soil; but the oppressive nature of the Gurc'hdli government, and the heavy exactions which it lays on the labou~ of the husband- 1 man, discourage cultivation. This Pn~ganah of 1 DhQn, lying between' the <span class="loc">Ganges</span> and Junzna rivers, which are here forty miles distant, is said to have VOL. XI.

Marched to Mu ra. The distance is esti- mated ten or eleven miles kr . E. by N. On this day's march, we crossed a mountain, about two thousand feet high, the ascent and descent of which were very steep and rugged. The mountain was, in some places, almost perpendicular; and ,the foot path cut out into zigzags of about thirty feet in length. In other places, it ran along a narrow ledge, not more than a foot in breadth ; while, on the outer side, was a precipice, of six or seven hundred feet. A most alarming pros- pect to persons unaccustomed to such situations; and here we ,had reason to admire the agility and steadiness of the hill people, to whom habit had ren- dered the travelling in such tremendous paths familiar. In the commencement of this day% march, we en- joyed a sigbt of uncommon beauty, which was ren- dered more striking by being concealed by a jutting point of rock, till we approached very near, and as- cended a little bank, when it burst suddenly on our view. It was a fall of water, from an excavated bank, with a cave or grotto at each extremity, forming to- gether an arch of about one hundred feet in perpen- dicular height, with a subtended base of eighty or one hundred yards. Through every part of the im- pending summit, the water oozed in drops, which fill in showers into a bason, whence it was carried, by a small stream, into the river below. The lofty trees and luxuriant shrubs which over- .hung the brow, threw a partial shade over the picture; while the sun, striking full upon the cascade, was re- Qected in the sparkling globules; giving a richness . . . . SURY.EY OF THE GA YGES. 467 and brilliancy to the scene, which words are incom- petent to express. The bason, or receiver, was a hard solid stone, of an ochrous colour, smoothed by the action of the water; but the bank itself was compos- ed of a thin coat of earth, of the same hue, but soft and friable at the top, and more indurated at the base. ' Upon an inspection of the grotto on the right, we were struck with new and more singular appearances. It is a cavern, about six feet in height, ten in depth, and fourteen or sixteen in length, and is a natural ex- cavation, the walls and roof of which are of rock. The water filters through the top, from which pen- dent shoots, like icicles, are disposed in all the dif- feren t stages of petrifaction. The small ramifications form variegated beds of moss, sewing as conductors for the water when it first begins to crystalize; and, from 'a tube or pipe, they become, by repeated incrus- tations, a firm consolidated mass. The various co- lours, produced by the vegetation, changing with the different shades of light, give to the outer surface the appearance of mother of pearl ; but when the petrifaction is complete, the inside has a great resemblance to alabaster. The water is excessively cold and clear; and, from an examination of the first process, one would be in- clined to suppose it impregnated with some fine mi- cous particles, which adhere to the vegetable sub- stance ; and by degrees, accurr~ulate into a solid body. We could with dificulty prevail on ounelva to quit this beautiful spot; but, as we had a long and ar- duaus journey to complete before the evening, we had only time to examine its principal beauties. It is called Sansdr Dharu, or the dripping rock. On this day's march we first saw the mountain pine, called by the natives Chk, or Khokin*. 468 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 19th. Marched to Bhhan Ddvi, a small village, so called from a temple which it contains, dedicated to a deity of that name. Distance computed -seven and an halfmiles, about N. E. by N. We crossed another mountain, .estimated at about one thousand and two hundred feet high. The thermometer in the morn- ing was at 48a0, and on this mountain we were de- lighted to recognize, among its vegetable productions, many of our European acquaintance, as the peach, apricot, walnut, strawberry, raspberry, dandelion, butter flower and white rose. Near the temple of Bbhan Ddvi stood a fine spreading fir, of the species which the natives call Deoddr*. It yields a great quantity of pitch, and the trunk acquires much larger dimensions than the <span class="loc">Chir</span>. The wood is more solid and durable, on which account it is more .prized by the natives for all purposes of building.-The adja- .cent hills were covered with forests of this tree. 20. Marched to Ldllari, a very small village, situated in latitude, by observation, 30" 33' s$"' Thermometer in the morning 52". On the first part of the march, the land on the road side was well cultivated, and even the sides of the hills were cut into small plats, rising one above the other, faced with stones and watered by the small streams which issue from the heights, and are con- ducted form the upper to the lower platforms in suc- cession. Here we found the Booranst and the Ballju, a species of oak. The mountairis are covered with immense forests of these trees. . Until one o'clock we had been gradually ascending, when we came to a small space of table land, whence * Pinus Doedwara. <span class="loc">Rox</span>. it.

SURVEY OF THE GANGES. .469 we beheld a sight the most sublime and awful that can be pictured to the imagination. We were now 011 the apex of one of the highest mountains in the neighbourhood; and from the base to the summit thc perpendicular height. could not be less than four thousand feet ; probably it far exceeded this calcu- lation. From the edge of the scarp, the eye ex- tended over seven or eight distinct chains of hills, one rising above the other, till the view was termi- nated by the Hirncilaya, or snowy mountains. It is necessary for a person to place himself in our situa- tion, before he can form a just conception of the scene. The depth of the valley below, the pro- gressive elevation of the intermediate hills, and the majestic splendor of the " cloud-capt" Hi.)nciluya, formed so grand a picture, that the mind was im- pressed with a sensation of dread rather than of pleasure; The intermediate ranges appeared to run nearly parallel to each other, and to have a general direction of about N. W. to S. E. The most distinguished peaks of the snowy range are those designated by the-names of Gangautri and Javnautri, whence the <span class="loc">Ganges</span> and Ja~nund rivers are supposed to derive their source.. The direction of the former, as taken by Lieutenant WEBB, from the spot where we stood, was N. 46O 3' E. its angle of elevation 3' 1'. The natives distinguished it-by the name Mahddkva ca-linga : its shape is pyramidical, with a broad base, and the point rather flattened. The 'latter bore N. 1 8' 34' E. i tg angle of elevation 3' 17'. These tcjb appeared. to be the highest peaks in the whole range. The horizontal distance of this extensive chain, according to the best estimate we were able to form, could not exceed thirty miles. By the computations of the native$, we were twelve days journey from the former ; but the experience0 which HI3 3 470 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. we have already had of the nature of the country, does'not tend to destroy the supposition, or render it extravagant. We began now to descend by what is called the N+r Glhdt; and it was two hours before we gained the base, which is watered by a rivulet called by the same name. From the middle of the Ghdt, we had a first view of the Bhcigirat'ht river, which was hailed by all our Hind,u servants with loud accla- mations, and with the accustomed terms of saluta- tion and respect. 81 st. Marched to MaugaEaa'tsh-ca-T'hrin, which is a place of worship, sacred to <span class="loc">Maha</span>'dkva, and in- habited by a Jhgi. Its latitude 30' 36' 30". N. This morning the thermometer was 54'. After ascending a Ghdt for about one mile, we came again in sight of the Bhdgirut'hj, distant from us about two and an half or three miles on our right. The stream appeared to run with great rapidity, and the breadth of it might be about forty or fifty yards. On the E. bank was a very pretty villager with fine. cultivation. It is called Haddidrd, and inhabited by JLgis. As we proceeded, the river opened more fully upon us; and we could perceive its course, winding at the foot of the mountains, for a considerable dis- tance, to the N. N. E. Some of the snowy tops of the Himdlayct were also visible, but we gradually lost sight of them, as we descended into the valley. The NqCr river here falls into the Bhdgz'rat'Ae'.- Our road now lay on the W. side of the vaney, which may be about one and an half mile in breadth, and prettily interspersed with hamlets. This is the only plain, deserving that appellation, that we have met with since we quitted the Dhhn PergmaR. This Alley is entirely confined to the yr. shore of SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 47 1 the Bhdgirdt'hi; the E. bank bein the base of a very lofty chain of mountains. The ! ills on our left had a very barren appearance ; but the fertility of the soil below began to increase, as the vegetation of the mountain proportionally lessened. On one side, scarcely a vestige of verdure or vegetation was to be seen, excepting here 'and there a solitary fir; while, on the other, the rich flourishing crops ex- hibited a pleasing contrast, and seemed to exult in the advantage of their situation. The sound of the rustic pipe first called our attention to the labours of the field, where we observed people of both sexes, engaged in their different agricultural pur- suits. The women take an equal share in the toil, and while the men direct the oxen with the plough, the women follow with the grain, and break the clods uf earth. Other families were employed in. rmping barley, for which purpose they.were pro- vided with a small sickle, with which they cut the grain about half way down the stem, and tie it up in bundles. The wheat and barley were sowed al- ternately in longitudinal rows of six or eight yards in breadth, and occupied the higher ground, while the lower was appropriated for the reception of rice, Mash,* Mnnduah,t <span class="loc">Sama</span>, $ kc. The fields un- der preparation for tillage were covered with rich manure of dung and ashes, by which the farmers are enabled to obtain an annual produce; but irr other places, the soil is often so unfriendly, that, after one culture, the ground is left fallow for two or three seasons, when the people collect all the grass and underwood in the vicinity, and by setting fire to it, prepare the land for the reception of an- other crop. We have hitherto had few opportunities . of gaining any insight into their art of husbandry, * Eruun~ Lens. f Cynosurus Coracanus. $ Panicum frumentaceunr. ROXB. . .. .H H 4 . . . . . W2 SURVEY 0% THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. for most of the villages were deserted ori our arrival ; but to-day we perceived a great difference in the manners of the people. They appeared to be much more civilized, and so far from exhibiting'any signs ' of apprehension, they came running towards the road, to see us pass. The women even, did not shew that bashfulness and reserve, which females in <span class="loc">Hindostan</span> in general exhibit ; but, mixing with the crowd, they made their comments with the greatest freedom. Their dress differs little from that of the men ; it consists of a short petticoat and a loose jacket with sleeves. Instead of the cap, they wear a piece of cloth bound round the head like a turban. Their garments are made of coarse cloth; whereas those of the men are of thick blanket, manufactured from the wool and hair of the sheep and goats, which are of .kinds peculiar to the hills. We could not help remarking, that, even in these unfrequented regions, the female mountaineers exhibited the general failing of the sex, having their necks, ears and noses, ornamented with rings and bcads. When these are beyond their means, they substitute a wreath or hunch of flowers; for which purpose the white rose is chosen, both for its beauty and scent. One of the 1argest.villages we past was <span class="loc">Chima</span>'li, in the vicinity of which were several fields of poppy, from which they extract opium. We saw also many trees of the wild barberry, with unripe fruit : the native name for it is Ringbr. After cross- ing a small spring, issuing from the mountains, we left a large village called 13urCtYha on our left. 1C.t is elevated about eighty feet above the bed of the river; and contains forty or fifty houses. From hence, we proceeded through fields, by a good foot- path, to the place of our encampment. Our ar- rival was ushered in by a couple of trumpeters, SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 473 ' wl~o welcomed us, with such a harsh discordant peal, that we were happy to give a little respite to our ears at the expense of our purse. The sunlmons wag, however, attended by several people from the neighbouring hamlets, particularly by those who were afflicted by any complaints for which they required medical assistance. Among these we observed a great number who had large tumors in the neck called gditre or wens, to which the inhahi- - tan ts of mountainous countries, particularly those who live in the vicinity of snow, are very subject. Fluxions and disorders in the eyes are also extremely common; and, in these months, the intermittent fevers are very prevalent. In this part of the country, they appear to be not only destiute of medical aid, but totally ignorant of any remedies to stop the pro- gress of a disorder ; and we saw repeated instances of people who had been laboring for years under the effects of a complaint or* wound, which was most probably very slight at first, but, from want of proper care, had risen to an incurable height. 22d. Marched to Ddnda ; distance six and an half or seven miles. Thermometer in the lnorniug 51O. After rounding a point of the mountain, by an ascend- ing path, we regained the bed of the river, and crossed a rapid stream, which falls from the west into the Bhdgirat'lbi, by a bridge called Sdnglba, which will be described hereafter. From hence, the passage of the road was too diffi- cult to allow ,us leisure to make any observations ; our attention being wholly taken up with our own safety. Following the course of the river, and round- . ing the different points of mountain, which mark .and occasion :the windings of the stream ; the road was a continued line of rise and fall, sometimes within fifty or one hundred feet of the base, at others, mounting to the height of two pr three thousand above the level . , of the river. In some places, large jutting points of rock formed a perpendicular ascent ; in which, at the distance of three or four feet, small steps had been worn by the passage of travellers. In other places, the road ran along the scarp of the hill, where the foot- path was at times trackless ; and when again visible, appearifig only in adismembered state, the earth hav- ing crumbled, or been washed away by the rain, leaving only a projecting stone to rest the foot upon. In these situations, and indeed during the whole of the march, a tremebdous precipice was open on the outer side ; and for the greater part of the way, we found it necessary to avail ourselves of the assistance of the bearers, to conduct us by the hand. The smoothness of the stone in some places, and the dry leaves often strewed over the path, rendered it 60 slip- pery, that we judged it expedient to take off our boots, to maintain a footing. To those who may hereafter . be inclined to pursue this track, it may not be an un- necessary precaution, to go provided with netted sandals, or socks of a texture sufficiently thick, to guard the feet from the sharpness of the stones. On our entrance into the valley, we saw vines, with the fruit beginning to form, and a few plants of aspsragus. rtsd. Marched to BiErdItat. Distance ab0u.t seven and an half miles.

', . . i . . . . . . - I SURVEY OF *HE GANGES. 475 Thcre are several kinds of bridges constructed fot the passage of strohg currents and rivers, but the most common are the Sdngha and Jhhla. The former consi~ts of one or two fir spars, thrown from bank to bank, or from one large rock to another ; but, where the extent is too great to be covered in this mode, they substitute the Jlfizitu or rope bridge, which is made in the following manner. A couple of strong posts are driven into the ground, about three feet asunder, with a cross bar, in the form of a gallows. One of these is erected on each bank of the river, and twelve or four- teen thick ropes divided equally to both sides, ieav- ing a space of abou t one foot in the centre, are stretch- ed over the scaffolds, and fitred into the groaad- by means of lage wooden piles. These ropes fotm the support of the bridge, which describes a catenary curve, with the lower part, or periphery, at a veatet or less elevation froin the water, according to the height of the bank. About two feet belo'w them, a rope ladder is thrown horizontally across, and laced with cords to the upper ropes, which form the para- pet, when the bridge is completed. The first passage of so unsteady a machine, is very apt to produce a sensation ofgiddiness. The motion of the passen ers causes it to swing from one side to the other, w \ ile the current, flowing with immense rapidity below, apparently encreases the effect. The steps are com- posed of small twigs, about two and an half, and some- times three feet asunder ; and are frequently so slen- der as to give an idea of weakness, which naturally induces a person to place his chief dependence on the supporting ropes or parapet, by keeping them steady dbder his arms. The passage, however, is so narrow, that if a person is coming from the opposite quarter, it is necessary that one should draw himself entirely to one side, to allow the other to pass ; a situation very distressing to a novice. The river at this place is about thirty yards in breadth, and the stream very 4; ti SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. rapid. Four men are enlployed in keeping the bridge in constant repair, for which they are allowed a smal,l portion of land, exclusive of a measureof grain, which they receive from each zemindar of the neighbouring villages at the time of the harvests. The town of Bdrahcit by no means answered the expectation we had formed of it, being in extent and population, far inferior to many villages we had passed on the road. The houses, like those of all the villages in this part of the country, are built of large stones, with slated roofs ; but none of them ap- pear in a habitable state. One cause, however, of its I preseut dismantled condition, proceeds from the inn- jurj:itsustained from theearthquake of 1 S03, in which all the houses suffered materially, and some were completely buFied in the ground. It is said, that two or three hundred people were killed by the falling in of the roofs ; and that great numbers of cattle were destroyed on that fatal occasion. Few of the habita- tions have been rebuilt ; and those that remain are so scattered and unconnected, that the place exhibits a striking picture of ruin and desolation. Bdrul~dt is the capital of a T&lt;ilziX.crh of the Rowuin Pergavmh, and originally derived that name from its being the chief mart of twelve villages, which send here their goods for sale. I I i Its central position enabled it to maintain a free communication with all parts of the hills ; and pil- grims, who are going to <span class="loc">Gangotri</span>, in general, halt here, I ! to lay in a stock of provisions for twelve or fourteen days, as there are no intermediate villages, where they could be certain of getting supplies. This latter cir- culristance must have chiefly contributed to render it a place of note ; as it does not appear that the town itself was ever very extensive, or that any great foreign traffic was carried on. The only article brought from BURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 477 any considerable distqnce, is salt from Btitcin ; but the quantity imported does not exceed the internal consumption of the place. The distance from hence to <span class="loc">Gangotri</span> is calculated at seven days journey, to Jumautri five, to Ceddriz Ndith twelve, and to Srtnager six ; but, excepting to. the latter place, the roads are very bad and difficult. That to Jantatri is considered by much the wurst. At this place we halted on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth, to procure a stock of provisions for our farther march ; as the inhospitable regions, we were r about to enter, afforded no prospect of any future supply. Althdugh we had taken the precaution to send on two Gurc'Adli Sipcihfs, two days before, to give notice of our approach, we could not on our arrival obtain provisions for that day, and parties sent- qut by the Stibaddr returned in the evening,. with only enough for the consumption of three days. . The next day was still less successful ; so that, finding we were not likely to get supplies without halting for several days, we determined to march the next morn- ing, and-trust to the promise of the Szibaddr, that he would forward them to Re'tal, a village near our road, and two days march from hence. On the hills near this place are great numbers of black partridges, (Perdin frar~colinus LATH.) and Chachrs (Perdix Rufa LATH .) A servant of Captain HEARSAY'S shot one of the latter. Near the village is a curious TrisiLl or trident, the base or pedestal of which is made of copper, in size ' and shape of a common earthen pot : the shaft is of , brass, about twelve feet long, the two lower divisions decagonal, and the upper one spiral. The forks of the trident are about eix feet in length. From each of the lateral branches, is a chai-n;r to'which bells were 4.78 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. originally suspended. By what means it came hither, or for what purpose it was constructed, no person could tell; and although the inscription be legible, and most probably contains the information, no one could even tell us in what language the characters are written. We had with us two or three men, who could read Ndgrf, Persian and Sawcrit, but they were unable to decipher a single letter. The lower part af the inscription bears some resemblance to the Chinese character, and the natives here havea tradition, that, many centuries ago, this part of the country was in- habited by, or tributary to, the Chines8 or Tartars ; and imagine it possible this trident may have been constructed by people of one of those nations. We were very unwilling to yield to this supposition, as we must have given it credit for greater antiquity than its appearance or probability would justify. The design far surpasses any of the kind we have yet met with, and the execution is above mediocrity. The circumference of the pedestal is not above three feet, forming a base so disproportioned to the height, that it was a matter of surprise the machine could main- tain its perpendicular position. It seemed as though theslightest touchwould havethrown itdown; butthe Brdhmen, who was in attendance, assured us it would defy all our efforts ; and it was not until we had made two or three unsuccessful attempts to overset it, that we discovered the cheat, it being fixed in the ground by an inaer shaft of iron, incased in that of the pillar. The only reason they assign for holding it in ~svesence, is from its being the smblem of one of their deities. It had formerly a temple erected over it, but in the earthquake of 1803, the mansian was thrown down, sad, wonderful to relate, the pilar escaped without injury. But a I:drge patched fracture in its side, a littk otqgeped our faith as to. ite mipaculous pwwatioli~. The former <span class="loc">Raja</span> dyapil, sent erne learned Pwdibs for the express purpose of deciphePing tbe inscription, but tki attempts. ware equally unsuccessful with 8. '. . .

Captain HEARSAY took an inverted copy of the inscription ; by smearing the shaft with ink, and applying long strips of paper to it, in the mode which the natives practise in taking off the impression of a aeal. 96th.

The grounds in some parts are allot- ted to the culture of poppy, which appeared to be in a very thriving state ; and we were informed that the opium extracted from. i t was of an excelleut quality. The village of Bat'hkri is placed on the hill, about three hundred feet above the bed of the river ; to the S. of it runs a small rivulet called the Rktal NadZ, which issues from the mountain, and falls into the: Bhdgirat'h t . There is a small temple sacred to MA- H A'DE'V A. It is constructed of large stones, piled one above the other, without mortar or cement. The form of it is conical, with a square sloping roof; and altogether, it has a great resemblance to a Chineee dl. On the opposite side of the river is an ex- traordinary cascade, which issues from the summit , of the mountain, and exhibits five distinct falls of water, one above the other. The lowest is the most considerable, descending, from the height of ninety or a hundred feet, in a perpendicular and solid body. The top of the mountain is covered with snow, from ' . a 480 SURVEY OF THE, <span class="loc">GAPI</span>'GES. the melting of which the waterfall derives its chief supplies. Near this villase, we saw a great variety of beautiful larkspurs of different colours, and the banks of the rivulet are prettily 'ornamented with hawthorn bushes in full blossom. - 29th. Thermometer 50'. The arrangements which had been made for getting our supplies at RE'tal, or at this place, obliged us to halt here to-day. Agreeably to the Stibuddr's promise, we found a sufficient stock of provisions for our people ; but it was requisite also to settle what part of our baggage could accompany <span class="loc">US</span>, and to leave every article that was not in a portable shape, in some place of security, until our return. The accounts we received of the roads were ofa nature the most discouraging ; and the difficulties represent- ed, far exceed any we have yet met with ; although we have passed many places, which, to a lowlander, appeared really alarming. These situations the Pahdris traversed with the greatest uncollcern ; but the continuation of the route from hence is, even in their ideas, frau~ht with danger. To a person who goes without a load, and is in the habit of travelling . in these mountainous regions, the distance to Gan- gotri is calculated at three or four days journey ; but we could not expect to reach it in less than six or seven days ; and to insure our attainment ,of it even in that time, we should be under the necessity of . . leaving our tents, Jawyuans, and even our beds be- . hind us. Whatever inconvenience we might suffer by being deprived of these necessaries, we determined not to relinquish the attempt, until we were convinced by ocular demonstration, that the prosecution of mr journey would be impracticable. In the room of the Jaa~p~~uns, we were obliged to substitute what is called a Daundl:, which is simply a pole with a blanket or small carpet slung to it, in the . form of a hammock. ' SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 48 1 29th. Leaving our tdnts, Jaqnpuans, beds, and . heavy baggage, at this place, under a small guard of Sepcihis, we commenced our march; and ten minutes walk brought us to a descent leading to the bed of I the Bhdgirat'l~i. Here the road lay over immense. stones and rocks, the passage of which was not only fatiguing but dangerous; for they were .heaped in such loose disordered piles, that the utmost caution was required in the footing. In some places, little 1 drippling streams, falling from the mountains, passed over the rocky bank, rendering the path very slip- pery. Fifty minutes over this road brought us to a / steep bank, which we ascended, and halted, to re- cover ourselves a little from the fdtigue we had al- l ready experienced. For fifteen minutes we proceeded along the banks, in a gradual rise, when we regainid the bed, by a very steep and almost perpendicular descent, of two hundred and fifty, or three hundred- feet. Here we met with the same obstructions as before; and we pursued our way over the rocky surface, for thirty-five minutes, when we again ascended, and receding from the Bhdgirat'hl, in- clined a little more to the W. 111 twenty minutes we arrived at the Su'ur <span class="loc">Nadi</span>, by a very steep de- scent. This is a rapid stream, about thirty feet broad, and over it is a narrow Sanglba, with a plat- form made of small fascines. Here we were again obliged to halt, for the pur- pose of gaining sufficient strength to encounter the ascent which 1qy before us. It was by a very narrow dangerous path, in some places excavated from the roc!, while a projecting point above obliged a per- son to stoop as he passed along, and threatened to precipitate him to the bottom. Forty-five minutes, in this laborioue ascent, brought us to the summit, whence we saw a large village, called Sdlang, about mid-way up to the hill, on the opposite side of the river. From hence, also, we saw two cascades, talling from the top of the same mountains, into the VOL. XI. T. I . 483 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. Bhdgirat'hf.. We now began to dece~id, and in fif- teen minutes, by a rugged path, we reached the banks of the CajanJ Nudi, which we crossed, and again halted. The impediments and fatigue we and our people - had experienced, in making a progress of three or four miles, through that part of the road which was considered as the least obstructed, but which, upon trial, we found to be not only difficult, but dan- gerous, naturally excited the apprehension, that our inquiries in this direction could not be prosecuted without the greatest risk ; and we consulted what, in the present circumstances, would be the best course to adopt. We were now within six or seven days journey of the place which is called Garlgotri; and to re- linquish it, when almost witbin our reach, was very contrary to our inclinations; although the informa- tion which Lieut. WEBB, Captain .HEARSAY, and myself, had been able to obtain, of the source of the Bhdgil-ut'hi, and of the existence of the cow's ' mouth, entirely removed all our doubts oil the sub- ject. From the appearance of the river itself, which becomes contracted in its stream, and from the stu- pendous height of the Hiwtdlayu mountains, whence - it flows; there can be no doubt but its source is situated in the snowy range ; and any other hypo- thesis can scarcely be reconciled to hydrostatical principles. The pilgrims, and those pe~ple in the vicinity of this place, who gai~ a livelihood by bringing water from the spot, say that the road be- yond <span class="loc">Gangotri</span> is passable only for a few miles, when the current is entirely concealed under heaps of snow, which no -traveller ever has or can surmount. With respect to the Cow's Mouth, we had the most convincing testimony to confirm us in the idea that its existence is entirely fabuloug, and that it is found only in the Hindd book of faith. .

Determined not to relinquish the rittempt, until I should be con- vinced that the impedime~~ts were of a nature to render the rose- B cution of my r-arches in this quarter impracticable, I ma e the neceeary arrangements on ply arrival at Bnr'hki, on the 27th ult. with the intent of continuing my rclute, under the inconveniences , and deprivatbns pf which 1 was led to expect. Having left a guard ip charge of the baggage, which was t&amp; heavy to be carried on, I proceeded the next morning ; but, in a progress of three or four miles, through that part of the road which is considered the least obstructed, 1 found the difficulties so far ex- ceeded what had been represented, that I was fully convinced, it would be in vain to persevere ; and I was at length induced to re- turn, from a consideration of the following reasons. 1st. Had no natural obstructions intervened, to render the attain- ment of the object doubtful, dl other considerations would neces- sarily have given way ; but when the prospect of success became uncertain, it was necessary to advert to other concurrent incon- veniences, which w'quld attend so precarious a journey. The alter- nate changes of the weather, from excessive cold in the morning and evening, to oppressive heat at noon, were such as no constitu-. tions uninured to the climate could well support ; particular1 under the exposure to which they would now be subjected ; and, gad any of the people fallen sick, which' ~vould undoubtedly have been the case, as many of them already began to feel the effects of this day's journey ; I was unprovided with the means of bringing them away ; and to leave them in an place of security would be equally impor- t I sible, as thb-part of t e country is quite uninhabited. M. The information, which I had already obtained, ffom some . intelligent persons, whobad gone on the pilgrimage, and from the iphabitants of Bat'hlri, many of whom gain a livelihood by bring- ing water from the spot, was of a nature to coqvinse me- that the rosecution of my inquiries in this Gection wouM not be pro- iuctive of any advantages to be put into competition with the hsrard and-difficulties that were likely to be opposed; for every account agreed, that the source of the river is more remote than the place called Ga7rg.autri, which is merely the point whence it issues from the Himcilaya, not as is related through a secret passage or cavern bearing any similitude to a cow's mouth, but its current is per- ceptible beyond that place, although the accese be so obstructed as to exclude all farther research. ad. By pr,osecuting the jowe for three or four days, and beix P then obliged to relinquish it, a de ap would be occasioned, by which the completion of my survey in another quarter would. be pre- I 1'2 .484 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. peared to us of sufficient weight t'o cause a decision in our future plans. Having communicated our in- tentions to the coolies, we began to retrace our steps ; and at five and a half reached the place which we had quittecl in the morning. Although we had provided ourselves with Daundis as substitutes for the Jampuans, we found them equally useless ; for we were forced to walk the greatest part of the way. In difficult and dangerous passages, a person is obliged to dismount ; but the conveyance itself is so extremely unpleasant and inconvenient, that curio- sity or necessity would be the only motives to induce one to have recourse to it ; and, after, he had once satisfied the former, he would not be desirous of a second trial. 90th. About twelve o'clock last night, came on a very heavy shower of rain, which continued with little intermission till the morning, and obliged us to halt. It was our intention, however, to have vented, as the advanced period of the season would not admit of my visiting the source of the Alucunawda river at Bhadrinoit'th be- fore the setting in of the periodical rains ; and as this river con- tributes equally to the formation of tEe <span class="loc">Ganges</span> at its junction with the Bhcigirat'hi river at Deoprycig ; it mas no less an object of in- quiry, and barely within the compass of the time I had before me. 4th. In the event of failure in this direction, all the purposes of the survey would be entirely defeated ; and even admitting I had been so successful as to mark the course of the stream as far as Gmgautri, a distance not exceeding sixteen or eighteen miles in a horizontal line, and found the appearance of the river such as had been represented, i could not have furnished so satisfactorily, or so complete a detail, as I had reason to expect would be supplied by a journey to Bhadrincit'h. These arguments made me relinquish the attempt, and I hope and trust that the reasons assigned will appear to you sufficiently urgent to have caused my decision, and that my present plans are in every respect.conformable to your wishes and instructions. To supply as well as possible the deficiency occasioned by my abandoning the tour, and to ascertain satisfactorily the correctness of the accounts I had received ; I dispatched an intelligent native, furnished with a compass, and instructed in the use of it, with directions to proceed to Gangautri, and I am in hopes his report will convey every necessary information. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 485 proceeded, had the weather cleared towards noon sufficiently to dry our tents ; but the people com- plained much of the fatigue they had undergone yesterday ; and most of them had their legs terribly \ swelled, from the bite .of a small ipsect, which we had found very troublesome forbsome days past. The ' - exercise had heated the blood, and the parts stung broke out into festers, and were extremely painful. , The weather was cloudy, *ith partial showers, the whole day. The tops of the mountains, at the base of which we had passed yesterday, were  his morn- ing covered with snow, that had fallen during the night; and from the appearance of the clouds, hanging over their summits, we suppose the snow continues to fall. As it was Lieut. WEBB'S intentiorl to depute a person to <span class="loc">Gangotri</span>, for the purpose of ascertaining the direction and appearance of that place, Captain HEARSAY'S moonshee, a very intelligent man, was selected fdr that undertaking. To render his ~bser- vations more correct, he was provided with, and in- structed in the use of the compass. It was also sig- nified to those of the Hindus who had set their minds on the pilgrim~e, and whose services were not immediately required, that they would be per- mitted to proceed in company with him, and rejoin us at Srinagar. Although the greater part of our establishment was composed of Hindus, there were ' only t'wo or three whose ardour was not damped by yesterday's march, and who availed themselves of 'the proffered ,indulgence. The greater number of them chose rather to send their offerings than present them in person. Two or three pilgrims, who had accompanied us from Haridwdr, were deputed to lay the gifts of the absentees at the foot of the holy shrine, and to brjng back a little water from the sacred fount. The com- mission was accepted with due gravity and reve- rence ; the deputy standi~g while he received the , purposed oblation, which was.a pecuniary one, pro- 113 456 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. portioned to the abilities or zeal of the offerer, 'who presented it in a prostrate posture, bowin$ to aad touching the feet of the pilgrim, The pilgrimage to <span class="loc">Gangotri</span> is considered 'a great exertion of Hindu devotion ; the performance of it is supposed to redeem the pilgrim from troubles in this world, and to ensure a happy transit, through all the stages of transmigration, which he may have to un- dergo. The water taken thence is drawn uqder the in spec ti or^ of a Brdhnen, to whom a trifling sum is paid for the privilege of taking it. It is .afterwatds offered up, by, or on the part of the pilgrim, at the temple of Baidya NdtA, a celebrated p1dc.e of Hinh worship in <span class="loc">Bengal</span>. q The specific gravity of this water is said to exceed that of the Alcananda; and, according to the belief of the credulous <span class="loc">Hindu</span>, is so pure as neither to eva- porate nor beco,me corrupted by being kept-.

The ascent was tolerably gradual, but the descent steep and difficult. 8th. Marched to Deu2i. Therm. 57. , On this day's march we crossed the Billang river, which is the most considerable stream we have met with, excepting the Bhdgirathi, and is considered sacred by the hill people, who saluted it in the usual tqms of respect. Its source is in a mountain, about two day's journey from this place, in an E. N. E. di- rection, and it falls into the Bhdgirat'hi about five miles to the S. W. near a village called <span class="loc">Tirhi</span>. The breadth of the current, at this season, is about sixty or seventy feet; pnd over it is a rope bridge, sua- pended on one side to a jutting craggy point of rock, , thirty or forty feet above the water, ad on the oppo- site bank to the branches of a very large Setnet or 114 48s SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. cotton tree.* The ascent to it is by a narrow path, cut in the rock, which leads to the entrance of the bridge ; and, on the opposite side, the descent is by a perpendicular ladder, placed at :the edge of the Stream. The Jhhlu is not in silch good repair as the ' one crossed at Jostudra; but the passage of it did not appear so formidable, as the water flows below with a smooth. even surface, not occasioning that giddiness which the rapidity of the Bhcigiret'hi tended to create. 9th.

Marched to Ddvaprayciga. Lat. 30' 8' 6" N. Therm. 70. This place is situated at the conflu- ence of the Bkdgimt'hi and Alucanundd. From the point where these two rivers meet, the Bhigirat'hi, as far as its course is perceptible, comes from the N. and the Alacunandd falls into it perpendicularly frqm the E. The contrast of the two streams is very re- markable; the former runs down a steep declivity, with a rapid force, roaring and foaming over large stones. and fragments placed in its bed, while the placid Almanandd, flowing with a smooth, unruffled surface, gently winds round the point, till, meeting SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 449 with her turbulent .consort, she is forcibly hurried down, and unites hkr . clamours with the blustering current. The dlucunanda', however, before the junc- tion, is, in width and depth, the most considerable stream; being. one hundred and forty-two feet in breadth; and, by the accounts of the natives who are resident here, it rises forty-six or forty-seven feet above its present level, in the rainy season. The rope bridge, by which we crossed, is elevated fifty-two feet above the present level of the water, and the people who have charge of it affirm, that in the rains it is frequently carried away. by the torrent. The breadth of the Bha'g-irat'hi is one hundred and twelve feet, and it is said to rise forty feet in the rains. It has also a J?uild thrown across it, a little above the junc- tion, and elevated about sixteen or eighteen feet. The banks of these rivers are composed of a hard. black rock ; those of the Alaeanundci almost perpen- dicular, to the height of eighty or one hundred feet ; those of the Rhdgirat'hi- stony, shelving and ex- panded. The union of these two streams forms the <span class="loc">Ganges</span>, the breadth of which is eighty yards at this season, immediately below the junction. ~EdPaaun'o is one of the five principal <span class="loc">Pra</span>,ydgs# mentioned in the Sa'stras, and is considered by all Hz'ndta as'a place peculiarly sacred. The town is si- tuated at the confluence of the B?~ci,oirat'hi and Ah- canundri rivers, and built on the scarp of the moun- tain, about one hundred feet above the water. It forms two sides of a square, one face looking towards tbe Alucaruandd, and the largest towards the Bhdgi- rat'hi. The foundation is a soil of .hard rock, in which a flight of steps is cut, leading from the water's edge to a considerable distance up the moun- tain, which rises eight or nine hundred feet above the town. The houses are in general two stories * This word is applied to the point'where two rivers meet. '' 3 GURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. ;h, built of large stones, with a coarse Cancar* rnent, and covered in with a sloping roof 'of shin- 3s. In the upper part of the town stands a temple, ored to I~AGHU-N'AT'H or RA'MACHANDRA. This ifice is constructed of large pieces of cut stone, piled ) without mortar. Its fornl is a quadrilateral pyra- id, bulging in the centre and decreasing towards the ~p, surmounted by a white cupola, over which, sup ~rted on wooden pillars, is a square sloping roof, Imposed of plates of copper. Above the whole, is golden ball and spire. It is raised on a terrace, lventy or thirty ywds square, and about six feet igh. The whole height of the building may be sixty ~r seventy feet. The entrance is on the western face, vhich has a portieo, where the religious perform heir devotions; and from the roof of which, bells of lifferent sizes are suspended., The presiding deity s seated at the east extremity, under the cupola, op posite to the door. It is an image about six feee high, cut in black stone, Pfrhich colour the face re- tains ; but the lower paYt is painted red. Opposite to the portico, and fronting the divinity, is a small cupola, containing the brazen image of a Gtsp.tjrda, represented under a human form, with an eagle's beak instead of a nose ; and to his shoulders are at- tached a pair of spreading wings. One knee is bent on the ground, and his hands are joined, in the atti- tude of supplication or prayer. Under the terrace is a temple sacred to MAH A'DE'VA. The bathing. place is at the point of junction ; and, as the water flows with great rapidity, three CCnb or basons have been cut in the rock, below the sur- face, to prevent the bathers being carried away by the stream. The to7kn contains two hundred, or two hundred and fifty hoi~ses ; and is inhabited by Brdh snens of different 6eCts; but principally those from, * A coarse kind of limestone, found in roundish nodules, gene- rally pretty near the surface of the earth.

E~clusive of the donallons and fees v+hich they receive from the pilgrims, for the prMkge of ba$hing, many of ahem keep sfiops, for the the sale of grain ; and the number of tavellets who pass this road, renders this , speculation probably the most lucrative. . Those p~rho perfoftn their abIutiohs,. ha've their names registered, by Brdhmev~8 of theiv own sect ; , and although we had not undergone the immersion, we were petitioned to add our names to the conse- crated list r an honour whic,h would not have been offered; without theae%pe6ation of a handsome re- ward. We paid, howevee, the sought for tribute, and had out names tecorded ; but with what class of Hindzks we were associdted, we did not take the tronble to ifitpire. The town was tetribly shaken by the e~thquake in 1803 ; many of the private houses, together with the te~race and cupola of the temple, suffered mate- rial ihjury. This latter has been lately repaired by the h~nds of Brdhmens, who were sent by DAULET RAO <span class="loc">SINDE</span>'A, under the inspection of his Guru or high priest, for the express purpose of restoring its dilapidations, as also those of Bhadrinht'ha, which is likewise under the superintendance of Br/iA~nen.as, from the Dekliin, and was much injured by the same convulsion. We could gain fio information, when, or by whom thd.edifise was wfi~tfwted; the only poi~t on which 499 SUBVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. the Brdhinu could speak positively, was, that it had been in existence ten thousand ybars. In the Alacanundd are a great number of fish'of the Rohic species (Cyprir~us denticulatus) four or five feet in length. They are fed daily by the Rrcihmens, and are so tame as to take bread out of the hand. We found the heat of the .weather to day very oppres- sive ; for our situation was such as to exclude every breath of wind ; which was entirely shut out by the high mountains, rising on every side.

The general di- rec tion of the road was N. E. by N. On this day's route we passed, a branch of the Alucunar~dd, over which was a DindZa, or sliding bridge. It is composed of three or four strong Me ropes, made fast on each bank; on these a small bedstead, about eighteen inches square, is made to traverse, by means of a couple of hoops, one at each end. On this machine the passenger is seated, and conveyed across, by a rope, pulled by a man from the opposite shore. -4 few paces beyond this, we passed what is called a <span class="loc">Mugra</span>, or artificial bank, through which water is brought to the road from some neighbouriny spring. It is made for the con- venience of travellers, and has a carved device of an elephant's head, fixed into it, for the passageaf the water. The breadth of the Alacallandd, at Rani B,ci.h, is about seventy or eighty yards. The stream runs at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour. . On the road' we met several pilgrims, returning from Ce'dd~a Ndth. Some of them informed us they ,SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 493 had travelled thence in nine days. We understood that the temple of Bhadri Nhth would be opened this day, and continue exposed, for the purposes of religious worship, for the six ensuing months. 1 ~th. Marched to <span class="loc">Srinagar</span>. Thermometer 73. The road Consisted of several ascents stnd descents ; and in some parts came in contact with the river. We met with several bushes of the red raspberry, the fruit of which was ripe, of a dark purple colour, ap- proaching nearly to black. It .is smaller than the white species, but does not possess an equal flavour, or that acidity which renders the other palatable to the thirsty traveller. Our first encampment was under a coupIe of mango trees, to the south of the town ; but the . situation in this low ground was so hot and unplea- sant, that we struck our tents in the evening, and. went to a mango grove, on a ridge, about four hun- dred paces to the south, where we found a very con- venient and much cooler spot, in a field of stubble. We had there the benefit of a freer circulation of air, and sufficient shade for the accommodation of a11 our people. Another advantage we derived by this re- moval was, that we were less exposed to the,curiosity of the natives, who came in such crowds about our ,tent, that two or three of the Gurc'ha'li Sepdhis were kept in constant employment, in restraining them from bursting. in upon us. So anxious were they to see what kind of beinqs we were, that a mes- senyer was deputed .by the -body corporate, to re- quest we would take a walk through the city, to gratify the curiosity of the inhabitants. The whole of the road, from Dkvapra.yciga,, is eft- ceedingly good, and has been lately repaired, by order of HA ST^ DHAL CHAUTRA, who went by that place to Harid~ocir. Excepting in two or three places, on a rocky ledge, where there is nothing to break the view ofthe precipice, and which could not be 494 SURVsY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. remedied, without great labour, the path is wide and even ; in fact, almost the only oneon which we could tiavel with satisfaction, without fear of being inter- rupted by obstructions, when it would be necessary to dismount from the Jampuuns. At this place we received, and returned, the visits of HASTI <span class="loc">DHAL</span>, the former governor, and ~SHISTA TAPAH, son of BHAIR~ TAPAH, who was in charge of the executive.government, during his father's ab- sence at Ccingra. Both these chiefs shewed us great civility; and from each of them we received a present of live stock and other provisions. Among these articles the fol- lowing are worthy of notice : 1. A young animal of the hog kind, called GzZrl; 5. A species of hill phea- sant, called ,Mundl,* answering so perfectly to the de- scription given by Col. HARDWICKE, ofthe Murghi Zerrin, we suppose it to be the same bird. The fe- male is called Dappca; and they are brought from the mountains in the vicinity of the Hi~nu'ta a. 3. Several small, and one large fish, called S' J der. The latter was caught h the Alacanandd, where the species is found in great numbers, some of an asto- nishing size, six or seven feet in length. The scales on the back and sides are large, of a beautiful green, encircled with a bright golden border; the belly white, slightly tinged with gold, the tail and fins of a.dark bronze. The flavour of this fish is equal to its beauty ; being remarkably fine and delicate. 4. The fruit called <span class="loc">Kuip</span>'hul, the produce of a tree of which we had seen great numbers on our road, and which is described by Col. HARDWICKE, (AS. Res. v. VI. p. 330.) This fruit is much admired for its very agreeable acidity. - By a mean of. our observations, taken by Lieut. SURVEY OF 'THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 495 WEBB, the town of Srknagar lies in lat. N. 30' 10' 52". It issituated on the S. bank of the Alacanandd, in the centre of a valley, which is about four miles in length, r'unning nearly in the direotion of E. N. E. to W. S. IV. and about two miles in its greatest breadth. The city extends along the banks of the river, and forms, in shape, a small segment of a circle, of which the stream constitutes the chord. The principal street runs through the city, about four furlongs in length, and contains the grand <span class="loc">Bazar</span>. The houses are in general two stories high, constructed of large stones, with a shelving slated roof of shingles. The lower apartments are allotted for shops and merchandize, the upper for the accommodation of the families. The rigid uniformity of the buildings, both in struc- ture and materials, shews what little advancement has been made in architecture, at the same time that it-de- tracts from the beauty of the place. A narrow project; ng verandah, or balcony, forms the only apparent differ- ence in the houses of the higher class of inhabitants ; and such a system of equality prevailg, that one ,might suppose it the effect of design, or of a cautious fear to manifest an i-ncrease of wealth, by an ostenta- tious display in their wtward appearance. Evep those of the two chiefs by no means convey the ide,a .of mansions appropriated to the residence of men to .whom was committed the government of a province. ' When Col. HARDWICKE visited this capital, in the year 1796, it was under the government of a <span class="loc">Raja</span>, to whom it had hereditarily descended through many generations ; and it might be supposed to be in its .most flouri&amp;ing state; yet its appearance was not darked with opulence or splendour ; but since that period, many natural and fortuitous causes have com- bined, to'reduce it to a lower state of poverty and in- Ggaificance. The encroachments annually made by sfhe Alawandti, on the houses contiguous to its cur- rent, the earthquake of ,1803, which shook every building from its foundation, ad the Gurc'hdli in- vasion at the close of the same year, formed such an 496 SURVEY OF THE GAKGE~. accumulation of evils on this devoted capital, that one might be inclined to believe it a decree of fate, that the city should not survive its native princes. Every house appears to ha~e felt the shock : in the main street, not above one in five is inhabited ; of some, the roofs have fallen in ; of others the walls are rent asunder, and many lie a complete heap of ruins. The palace of the <span class="loc">Raja</span> is exactly in the same situation ; son~e parts of it are entirely dismantled, and others in so tottering a condition, as to render it unsafe to pass under its walls. Many of the inhabit- ants, who attended us, expressed much sorrow at these events; and spoke of their former sovereign with great marks of feeling. They seemed to have pleasure in relating little anecdotes, that brought him to their recollection; and talked, in the presence of some Gurc'hdli Sepahis, in a manner that asto- nished us. " These," cried one, " were the apart- ments allotted for the Runis and her attendants;" " in those," said another, " the <span class="loc">Raja</span> held his court, here he pecformed his religious devotions, and there he used to repose in the heat of the day; but all is now gone to wreck, and what the earthquake saved, the Gurc'hdlis have destroyed." / These sentiments were no doubt dictated by their real feelings; for whatever oppressions they might formerly have la- boured under, they no doubt fell sh~rt of the exac- tions of the present day. Under its Gurc'hdli rulers, the city is not likely to recover from this forlorn condition ; for all classes of people complain much of the peculation of the chiefs, and of the injustice, with the want of method,. that attends all their proceedings. On our putting tbe question to some of the complainants, why they con- tinued under so arbitrary a government, or why they did not .endeavour to procure a subsistence elsewhere; they answered, that it was the place of their births ; that a removal to the low lands, after a certain age, was fatal to their constitutions; and that habit had so far reconciled the e~isting evils to their minds, that of two ills they preferred SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 497 what they thought the least. The inhabitants are , composed chiefly of people, descendants of emigmnts from the Dudb, Rohilc'hand and <span class="loc">Aud</span>?~ The greater portion of them are Hindus; the num- ber of Mussehnan families not exceeding sixty or seventy. -Most of these are petty shopkeepers, who, to gain a scanty subsistence, are forced to enter into var~ous speculations ; and a piece of silk or a skr of onions may be procured at the same shop. The prin-, cipal persons are the agents of great banking houses at Najibabcid and in the Pudb, who are employed in the sale and exchange of merchandize and coins. They reside here only eight months in the year ; quitting the hills, and returning to their houses, at the commencement of the rainy season. The traffic in silver and specie forms one of the most profitable branches of commerce, aud is carried on to a consi- derable amount. Bullion and coins are imported, for the purpose of being converted into Tenadshas, the currency of the hills ; and as a constant coinage of them is kept 'up at the mint, the supplies are fur- nished by the Serrdfs, who receive a premium, agree- able to the quality of the silver, amounting to one and a half, or two per cent. on the Furrakdbdd or Barkli rupee. The Temcishu is a small uneven silver coin, four of which pass for the nominal rupee of the hi1 1s ; and five for the Furrnkhdbad or Bardli. Spanish dollars also find their way hither, and are converted into the same ourrenc The inferior coin is a small piece, ten <span class="loc">Tacas</span> of w 6' ich are equal to one Terncisha.   he other articles of speculation consist in the pro- dug= of the hills, and imports from But&amp;&amp;. The former are bhang, (hemp); a eoarse cloth; or sort of canvas, manufactured from it, called Bhangelu; lead, copper, drugs, gums, wool, and a species of flannel made from it called <span class="loc">Panc</span>' hi ; from Butdn are received rhaurs or cow-tails, musk in pods, saffron, borax, VOL.

Among the drugs is one called Nirbisi,* held in great value and re- pute, by the natives, for its supposed medicinal qua- lities, as an antidote against the bite of a snake, and -for its efficacy in healing tumors, sprains, boils, &amp;c. by rubbing it over the part affected. In shape and appearance it somewhat resembles a shrivelled date, of a dark colour, and has a strong bitter taste. They judge of its quality by wetting and rubbing it on a piece of cloth; if it yields a bright purple, it is pronobnced fresh and good. The English name for is Zedoary. Hawks are also brought down from the hills. In exchange for the above, the following ar- ticles are supplied from the low countries. Coarse cotton and woollen cloths, silk, spices, Laltom salt, sugar and tobacco. On all these goods a greater or less duty is levied at Srknagar, amounting on an ave- - rage, to one Ana in the rupee, or about eight and a third per cent ; and additional duties are collected at different posts, in their transit through the copntry. These imports are not regulated by any fixed prin- ciples ; but a retrospective reference is frequently made to the accounts of former years; and if the statement of the owner falls short of the usuai amount . imported.by him, the duties are proportiona11y aug- mented. A free communication formerly existed with the people of BWn, who were in the habit of bringing their goods for sale to this market, and taking hence other commodities in exchange ; but, owing probably to the above exactions, they have discontinued the practice, and very little direct inter- course is now maintained. The annual amount,of traffic, carried on at this capital, must be very in- considerable; for most of the above articles art? pro- 1 duced in as great abundance, and find an easier 1 - - * C117.cun1o XLdoni.ia. p. 335 of this Volume.

The territories which formerly belonged to the . <span class="loc">Raja</span> of Srinugar, are now divided into eighty-four Pe~~anuhs; included in three Yut'his, 'or divisions ; over each of which is appointed a military governor, who has the same jurisdiction in his own district. The three Serddrs now in office are BH A IRO TAP AH, Buu~i <span class="loc">TAPAH</span>, and <span class="loc">PARSURAM</span> <span class="loc">TAPAW</span>, all of whom are employed in the siege of Cdngra; while . the affairs in this quarter are transacted by deputies, who hold pro temnpore the authority of the chiefs, and pass decision on all civil causes. If a reference is made by the inhabitants of two districts, the <span class="loc">Ser</span>- ddrs of t.hose districts meet in council, to determine the point. The mode of proceeding is undoubtedly very summary ; and in criminal cases a court of ju- dicature may be considered unnecessary ; for, when an unlimited power of life and death is vested in the governor, a form of trial becomes a mere mockery. 'I'he common mode of punishment is by levying a <span class="loc">Dand</span> or fine, upon a Perganah, village, or indivi- dual ; and in default of payment to seize the person, property, or families of the offenders. It had long been a plan in agitation, at the court of. Napcil, to invade the territories of the <span class="loc">Raja</span> of Srinagar, and to extend their possessions to Cashmfr. So far back as the year 1791, after re- ducing Cam&amp; and its dependences, the Gurc'hd- 22s made an attempt to subdue the country of <span class="loc">Gar</span>- god&amp;,- but the opposition they met with, at the fort of Lanmdr, before which they were unsuccessfully detained for upwards of twelve months, and the in- vasion of Napdl by the Chinese Tartars, drew their forces from this quarter, and obliged them to post- pone their project to a later period. The result of this expedihon, however, tended to render the <span class="loc">Raja</span> KK 2 .. a() SURVEY 08 THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. of Srinagar tributary to Napcil, and he entered into terms, to pay in homage, the annual sum of three thousand rupees, and to maintain, at his own ex- pence, a <span class="loc">Vacil</span>, or agent, from their government. The sum above stipulated was increased, under va- rious pretences, to nine thousand rupees; while the establishment of - the resident, with the exactions made by the different Gurc'hdli chiefs, who, under pretence of going on a pilgrimage, passed through the capital, , for the purpose of obtaining presents, - suitable to their rank, amounted to thrice the sum of the augmented tribute. Neither did this treaty se- cure the country from the irruptions of the Gurc- 'hcilis; inroads were made in different directions, and cattle and other articles of plunder carried off. Such was the state of affairs till the year 1803 ; when the ~nask was thrown off, and an army of eight or ten thousand men was sent from Napcil, to cany their favourite project into execution. The com- mand of this body of troops was entrusted to AMER SING CADZT, and to <span class="loc">HASTI</span>' DHAL CHAWTRA, who, entering the country, under the pretext of claiming some arrears of tribute, marched, in two parties, directly towards the capital. The knowledge they had acquired of the nature of the country, by so long and free a com~nunication, in some measure favoured their progress ; but they met with little op- position from the <span class="loc">Raja</span>, who was a man more in- clined to a life of indolence and dissipation, than to encounter the toils and dangers of war. His troops, it is said, amounted to fifteen or twenty thousand men ; but they were conlposed principally of merce- naries, who endeavoured to shun an engagement ; and, after having made a short stand at Barihdt, fled to Gu~.udwciru, whither they were pursued by the invading army; and the dath of their chief, on those plains, secured the conquest of the whole country to .the Gurc'l~cilis. After remaining in GeraaZ for a SURVEY OF THE GAN.GES. =I short time, for the purpose of making some internal arrangements, and appointing provisional governors during their absence ; the two victorious chiefs pro- ceeded with their troops, in the direction of Cash- YILI~; but were stopped in their progress by the for- 'tress of Cdngra, a strong hold belonging to <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">SAKSA</span>'R-CHAND. It is situated on a high and steep mountain, about twenty Cbs to the W. of the Beyah river, or Hyyhasis; is .well supplied with water, and contaii~s sufficient ground to yield subsistence to the garrison ; consisting of three or four thousand men. Before this place, the Gurc'hdlis have been ever since employed; and all their efforts to get possessioil of it. have hitherto proved ineffectual.* About twb years after the conquest of Srirmgar, HA ST^ DH AL was called from Cdngra, to assume the government of these districts, in conjunction with his brother RUDRAV~R SA'A, who was sent from Nap&amp; to nbtify and, receive the appointment. Having repaired to this capital, and being invested with the chief controul, 13~~~1 DH A L remained at Srinagar; while his brother RUDRAV~R, who had brought reinforce- ments froin Napdl, went in his room to Cdngra. The siege was,now turned into a blockade; but the in- ternal resources of the garrison baffled all the endea- vours of the besiegers; while the revenues of this country were drained and msted, in the support of the Gurc'l~dli army. In this posture of affairs, it was deemed advisable to enter into some kii~d of treaty wjth <span class="loc">SANSA</span>'R CHAND : and a messenger was sent to him, on the part of .AMER SINH, to propose terms of 'hegociation. Although this ~erdkr held the first military eom- mand in the Gurc?l~dli army, tile Cdngru , . <span class="loc">Raja</span>, who * It has tie . since ceded to the Sikhs, who have been called ia as auxiliaries, ankave repulsed the Gurc'hoL. KK 3 502 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. is a RGptct of high cast and principles, refused to treat with a person, who, like AMER SI NH, has risen from an inferior station, and was of a lower cast; but declared himself ready to accept of the mediation of RUDRAV~R, whom he considered an equal. RUD- RAV~R SA'A, taking the responsibility on himself, accordingly offered terms, which were accepted ; viz. that the sirge should be raised, and <span class="loc">SANSA</span>'R C~AND be reinstated in all his possessions, on paying a sum of three lacs of rupees to the Guyc'luill. The treaty, however, was conditional ; and the ratification post- poned, until an answer should be received from Napdl. The state of politics at that court was not likely to prove favourable to the arrangements of RUDRAVCR; for, since the accession of the present Raja, GHUR BAN JUDH BICRAMA SA'HI, a boy about nine or ten years of age, the councils and en- tire management of the state are entrusted to, or rather have been usurped by BH~M SIN'H TAPAH, aman of low origin, and whose object it is to raisea strong party of his own cast, to oppoee the interests of the Chawtras, who are Rdjputs, and uncles to the reigning prince. The Tapahs are Casias, or cul- tivators of land, and are formidable from their num- ber. To this cast AMER SINH belongs ; and the degrading language held to him by <span class="loc">SA</span> NSA'R GH A KT), induced him to make an unfavourable report of the treaty, by saying the distresses of the gar- rison had caused the Cdrhgra <span class="loc">Raja</span> to accept of the terms; and he pledged himself to reduce the fort to an unconditional surrender, in' the course of three or four months. The removal of HAST] DRAL ahd Ru DR A vi~ from their appointments, was the conse- quence of this treaty; which, though the ostenaible, was probably not the real cause of their supelses- sion. They were succeeded by the Taparb <span class="loc">Ser</span>&amp;re, who now hold the government. These intrigues have created a jealousy, which may b@ductive SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 503 of seriot~s consequences; it is confidently reported and expected here, that a civil commotion is now on foot, and will shew itself openly in a short time. . - On taking a view of Sq.inagar from a height, it has the appearance of a double valley ; one situated on a level with the river, the other on its banks, elevated about forty or fifty feet, and extending along the base of the mountain. The lower one, in which the city stands, bae apparently been formed by the receding of the Ahcaaandd from the south shore; and, al- though the period be too remote to ascertain the fact, the appearance of the ridge or bank, marking the concavity, would incline one to suppose that such has been the case; and that, in its present progres- dive inclination, it is gradtially returning to its former channel. From the bottom of the upper valley, to the city, is a space of three or four furlongs, laid out in -11 fields and enclosures, with a few mango trees, thinly scattered among them. Opposite to the city, the Alummad divides into two or three streams, which reunite about one mile below. On one of the small islands, are the ruins of buildings, which weze formerly connected with the city. The aspect of the surrounding mountains is very barren ; here and there a solitary tree may be seen ; but the general features betray a rocky and unfriendly soil ; and the little vegetation that is produced on them, is soon parahed up and dried. On the opposite side of the rivet, meM ham ts are seen, situated along t the foot of the hills, \ ith which a communication iflopen, bya J?dd to the W. and afer boat tothe X E. of the city. One of the largest of t ese villages is called Rdni Hdt'i, containing a temple sacred to <span class="loc">Raja</span> I~WARA, at whose shrine some rites are per- formed, in .imitation of the mysteries observed in the temple of the Cypriun goddess. It is inhabited chiefly by dancing women ; and the ceremony of ini- tiation to this society consists in anointing the head KK4 504 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. with oil, taken from the lamp placed before the al- tar ; by which act, they make a formal abjuration of their parents and kindred,' devoting their future lives to prostitution. A short distance beyond it is a Mat'h or fane of RASSEA DE'v~, the god of love ; whose shafts, if we may believe the reports and com- plaints of his numerous votaries, are tainted with a fatal and pernicious poison : indeed, his wounds ap- pear to be so generally diffused, that four-fifths of the inhabitants are supposed to labour under the ef- fects of them; and the calamity is heightened by their ignorance of proper remedies to check their progress. At this place, w&amp; had an opportunity of seeing a curious ceremony, which is occasionally observed by the hill people, and took place on the opposite side of the river, nearly in front of our tents. It is klled the Bhurt or Bhe'd'a; and is a kind of propitiatory oblation to the genius of the mountain, to draw down his blessing on the land, and preserve the crops from the destructive ravages of rats and ver- min. A thick rope, of amazing length, was made fast to a stake, near the bed of the river; and the other end carried, by eighty or one hundred men, to the top of a hill, nearly one mile in ascent; and be- ing passed through a running block of wood, it was secured to a large tree, and made as tight as it could be stretched. On this hazardous vehicle, a man of the cast of Nut's, or tumblers, was placed astride, and, without being tied, or'having any aid to pfe- serve his balance, excepting some large bags of sand, fastened to his legs and thighs, be was started from the summit, and arrived in safety at the bottom. The omen was considered fortunate, and the enterprise liberally rewarded, by the Zcmindars, or owners of the land. Had the man lost his seat, and fallen, he would most probably have been killed on the spot ; but death was at all events the forfeit af hilure ; for .SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 505 had apy life remained, the head was to have been severed from the body, to be offered up, as a sacri- fice, or atonement, to the offended spirit. This su- perstitious~custom obtains, in many parts of the hills; and is generally resorted to, after a bad harvest. About four o'clock in the evening, came on a violent squall from the north-west, attended with rain, which lasted for a couple of hours. The day had been excessively hdt ; and the thermometer stood, in the tent, at 101'. The storms,, at this sea- son of the year, may he considered periodical, at this place ; for we. had experienced them, in a less or greater degree, every everling, since our aaival ; and .the inhabitants informe'd us, that for tbis and the ensuing month, the day.regularly closed with one. 0 I On the lt3th, after repeated messages to the chief, . SHISTA TAPAII, it was at length settled, that the same establishment should proceed with us ; and the rates of hire were fixed, by contracti from Bhadri Ndth to <span class="loc">Almora</span>. The balance due on the last, and the necessary ad- vance of the new agreement, having been sent to SHISTA TAPA H, the requisite Perudnas were made out, and stamped with the seals of the three chiefs. 'In the morning, we were joined by the party from <span class="loc">Gangotri</span>, who all returned in health and spirits. The sequel of their journey+ after quitting us, was, by their account, a series of difficulties and hair headth escape?, which were no doubt a little ex- aggerated ; but what greatly tended to obstruct their progress, was the heavy rain, for three or four days successively, which attended them in their outsee Two days before their arrival at Gungotrf, they were overtaken by a fall of snow, which occasioned no small alarm and inconvenience to the party, .none of whom had ever experienced, or seen, but from a cnci SL'BVEY OF THE GAXGES. distance, the element in this flaky state of congeal: ment. The description the -51unshi gave of the ap- pearancx of' the river, corroborated by the observa- tion~ of his companions, was such as accorded with our previoue information. A few miles beyond Gan- gotri, the river is entirely concealed, under beds of eriow ; beyond which no person has hitherto been able to penetrate. The brvdth of the stream is about fifteen or twenty yards; the current moderate, and riot above waist deep. Two miles beyond, is the spot called Gau-vnuc'hi, or the cow's mouth. It is a largc: etone, situated in the middle of the bed; the wiltcr passes on each side, but a small piece of the' tingrr~ent is disclosed above the surkce, to which tascy may attach the idea of the object*. The river rutla from the direction of N. by E. and, on the bank nt:ar G'u~igotri, is a small temple, about eight or ten feet high, containing two or three images, represent- ing the Gangd, BhdgiratiiE, &amp;c. There are three Cundae or basons, where the pilgrims bathe, called Urdhgna-cunda, , Vieluctc-cunda and Suryd-cunda, formed in the bed of the river. The mountains in the vicinity have a very barren appearance ; the only tree produced there is the Rhu~japatra. 19th. Marched to &amp;ti.

BURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 507 The whole of the road to-day was a continued rise and thll; but th6 path was generally speaking good, In tllc steep of ascent or descent, or whew the soil was hard aad rocky, small steps had been formed, by the passage of travellers ; and in rsome places stones had been laid, to render the access easier. Consi- derable pains and labour appear to have been be- stowed, in making this road passable; indeed it must be a great object of the government, to remove all obstructions, and keep the communication with the holy places as open as possible 1 as the numerous pil- grims, who pcasa annually, must pme a great sout-ce of revenue. Near the banke of the small streams, and under the cavities of the rocks, temporary habi- tations have been made, by the pilgrims, who travel together in small parties, and pass the niqht in Rny convenient spot they may find #on the rot&amp;. Under the shade of large trees, small Chabuirus are raised, of loose stones, near which they generally halt, in the heat of the day, to prepare th8ir meals. A great number of people, of%oth seaee, passed us, on their return from Cedcira and Bhadri Na't'lh. They were principally inhabitants of the Penjdb: those who come from the easter11,parts of the country strike off from Carn-prccyidg to Alrnora. The Fakirs composed the majority of the multitude ;. and were very trou- blesome and iniportunate in their demands. In the early part of this day's maroh, we came to the top of a mountain, about four or five a hundred feet above the level of the river, which runs immediately below it ; and from hence, we had a view of six or seven rdnges of mountains, running parallel to each other, from about N. E. to S. W. On several of the hills, which we.passed, the grass had been lately set on fire; the whole surface was black with soot, and the trees completely naked. On the summit of one of these mountains is a small space of table land, in the middle of which is a tomb, called Puch-bhdi, by 508 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 1 2 1st.

We first 'passed throuqh a forest, inhabited by the species of baboons, cilled in . Hindzistan, LangBr, and here Ghicni. On this day's .march we saw the confluence of the Alacanar~dci with the Ca'h <span class="loc">Ganga</span>, a large stream which rises in the mountains, of Ckddr, and is in the Scfstra denominated Manddcini. Its junction with the Alacanandd, called -Rbd.mprayciga, is one of the five principal Pray&amp; as megtioned in the sacred books of the Hindus. $he pilgrims, who visit the temple of Ckdcir-Ncith, . generally pursue the road on the W. bank of the Alacanclndd river, and follow the track of the <span class="loc">Mand</span>&amp;cinf from the point of junction. At an inconsiderable elevation from the water, is a small ~id'h, or temple ; and a few houses, inhabited by the Brcihmens. Farther on, is a large fragment of rocks, called Bhim-ca-Chicla. It is about thirty feet high, and fifteen feet in dia- which. name the pass is also designated. It is a ~ Chabutra, about six feet square, built of large pieces 1 of slate, with five stones, placed perpendicularly in the centre, to represent the five brothers; the tomb stands here a monument of the effects of usurpation and of female revenge. The persons whose ashes it contains, were the relations of UPE'NDRA SAH I, one of the former Rajas of Srinagar, at whose death the government devolved to his nephew, the infant son of DULEBH SAHI. These brothers, who were next of kin, usurped the management of the state, and , are said to have committed the most horrid .acts of cruelty, until the Rcini, the mother of the child, formed a plot to way-lay them at this pass; and thus relieving the country from their tyrannic sway, she reinstated the young <span class="loc">Raja</span>, <span class="loc">PRETA</span>'B SAHI, and her- self assumed the regency.

Marched to Carna-praydga, the confluence of the Alaca~~andd with the Pindar river, which comes from the S. E. This is another of the five Praydgus, mentioned in the Sdstl-as, and considered the third in point of consequence, The village con- tains only six or eight houses, with a Mut'k, or shrine, in which is placed the image of <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">CARNA</span>.

The road is winding, with steep ascents and de- scents ; and in some parts not a little dangerous ; being formed on a ledge of rock, with here and there a small projecting point, not above five or six inches wide, to rest the foot upon ; requiring .the utmost care and caution in the passage. On this day's march we passed a fixed bridge, built by. the Gurc'hdlis, a few years ago. The bank, on each side, was faced with stone, in the form of a pier head, from which strong beams were thrown out horizontally, the one above the other : the lowest timber projected about two feet, and each successive one was lengthened, in this progressive proportion, so as to compose an arch, leaving only a space of ten or twelve feet in the centre, to be covered with . strong planks. The model of this bridge appears to 510 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. be entireIy foreign ; and it was most probably intro- duced into this country by the Gurc'hilis. It had- a very neat appearance; but it would seem not so well calculated as those of a nore yielding nature, for these rapid streams; aa, either from the force of the current, or the hardness of its construction, some of tbe timbers had given way, and the upper planks had fallen in ; although the materials ap- peared perfectly sound and new. A little beyond thie, we entered a fine extensive plain, about one mile -and a half in diameter, encir- cled by an amphitheatre of hills. A lqe space of it was covered with rich grass, on which great numbers of cattle were grazing. I11 the centre was a large Yipel* tree with a Chabtrtra. This part of the valley is called Gaochur, and appropriated solely for pas- tumge ; to which the inhabitants of all the neigh- bowing. villages have a common right.. The follow- ing is the reason assigned for this ground being un- cultivated. Several years ago, a Ze~nindar, belong- ing to this place, happened, by chance, to kill a cow, which had intruded upon his premises ; and being distressed, not only on account of the impiety of the act, but of the penalty to which he was sub- ject, by the Hindu law ; went to represent his mis- fortunes to a rich Sblruc~ar, or merchant, from the Dekhin, who happened to be near the spot, on a journey of pilgrimage. The merchant was an eye wibss of the accident; and, being touched with cornpaemon, purchased the ground for three tbouwd rupees, ;md offered it up to Bl~adri Nut'A, in the name of the guilty person, as an atonement for the offence ; on the express cwclition, that it should be applied to w other purpose, than that,of pasturage, Farther om, we passed Pdta, a large neat village, 1 BUBVEY OF TH5 GANGES. 51 1 contilining forty or fifty huts, situated about one hundred feet above the base of the mountain. Three C&amp; to the south of this place, are the lead and cop- per mines of Dhanpzir. They are at present farmed, for the annual sum of four thousand rupees, by a man named PUKI SONAR, whom we saw at the capital, and who furnished us with a few specimens of the ores. The copper is produced in various soils ; it is sometimes mixed in strata of different c:loured clays, and sometimes runs in veins, through hard and solid rock. When the veins are rich, they yield two thirds of metal, but the average quantity extracted, amounts to about one half. Two or three hundred people are employed, the whole year rouad, in working the mines, and smelting the ore ; the pro- cessVof which is very simple, consisting only in pounding the ore, and making it up, with cow dung, into balls, which are put into a furnace, sufficiehtly heated to produce a fusion of the metal. About four C6s to the north, on the opposite hills, are the copper mines of Ndgpzir; which, although consi- dered the richest of any in the <span class="loc">Srinagar district</span>, are not worked at present: as a considerable capital would be required to-open them, and no person has been found willing to undertake the risk, under the precarious security of Gurc'hdli faith. At seven minutes past three, P. M. we expe- rienced a sli&amp;t shock of an earthquake, which lasted for six or seven seconds, accompanied by a rumbling noise, like distant thunder. Our tent was pitched at the foot of a h~gh mountain, covered with rock and large stones: the daily ocular dwonstrations we had of the destructive effects of these convulsions in the hills, made us not a little apprehensive for our safety ; and we sought for refuge on the plain, wHere we waited for sope time, in anxious expeta- tioa of the result. The temple of MA.HA'DE'VA stood a melancholy proof before us, having lost its 512 SURVEY.

After remaining for some time in this situation, and finding the shock was not repeated, our alarms began to subside. We had found the day extremely hot, but the them. stood only at 94, a few minutes after the shock had taken place. 23d. Therm. 72.

Four of these ' holy places of ablution we have already passed ; the fifth is Alluhabad, which is called Bhat-praydg, or by way of distinction, as it is the largest, and con- sidered most holy, it is simply denoted by the hame of Praydg. There was formerly a temple, and a. small village, at this place, but no remains of either are now to be seen. A few Baniahs have fixed their temporary shops here, for the purpose of selling grain, to the passengers ; and to supply the defi- ciency of a temple, in a place of such sanctity, a few loose stones are piled up, in the form of a Clsabutra, on which some Hindu ima, es are exposed, for the adoration of the pilgrims. 2 Brdbnen has stationed himself here, to receive the offerings at this season ; but, as the temple, with its contents, are scarcely worth preservation, it may be presumed, that he officiates only during the time that the grand croyd is passing.

The en- 1 . trance to the town is by a bank, cut into steps, faced with slate and stones. It contains one hundred, or one hundred and fifty houses, neatly built, of grey stone, and roofed-with shingles. They are raised to . the height of two or three stories, with small areas ' - or enclosures, with a flagged terrace. The.streets are pived, but in a very irregular manner; some parts with large round stones, and others with flags of slate. The first object that attracts notice, on en- tering the town, is a, line of water mills, placed on the slope, at the distance of fifteen or twenty yards from each other. The water,'which turns them, is supplied by a stream, which, flows down the moun- tain, and, having passed through the upper mill, is conducted to the next, by a communication of troughs, made of the hollowed trunks of firs. -A few paces beyond, is the house of the Raziilil, or high priest of Hltadri-Ndt'l~, who resides here, during the six months of the year that the temple at that place is shut up. At the commen'cement of the cold wea- ther, when the snow begins to accumulate on the mountains, all the inhabitants quit that neighbow- hood, and take up their residence at this place, until the roads become again accessible. Adjoining to this house is a temple, containing the image of <span class="loc">NARA</span>- SI XGHA, one of the Hindit deities. . It was placed here, by a native of Cajncion, of .the Jhsi (Jyltishi) class of Urn'lt~nens; and this town has since borne its present appellation, in honour of the idol.

The doors were .not open. when we went to visit it in the evening, and we were consequently oL!iged to return without seeing the inteiior of it. In the upper part of. the town is a large square, where the pilgrims who halt here put up for the night. To . the right of it is a stone cistern, with two brazen spouts, whence water keeps constantly flowing into ' a bason below. It is,constructed for the convenience . of the town's people, and supplied by the stream from the mount'ain. Close to it, extending along another face of the square, is a collection of temples, which bear the marks of great antiquity. They are raised on a terrace, about ten feet high, and in the centre .of the area,. stands the principal one, sacred. to VISHNU. It is surrounded by a wall, about thirty feet square : at each angle, and in the centre of each face, are inferior temples, containing different deities. Several of them were destroyed, and thrown down by the earthquake; and moitpf them are in a very tottering condition. Those which suffered the least, . and have the images perfect, are the temples of '\T~~~~'~, GANE'S'A, SU'RYA. or the sun, and the N AU-DE'V~. Of these, the statues representing the two former are carved in a very superior style of workmanship. The firs* is an image cut in black stone, about seven feet high, supported by four fe- inale figures standing on a flat pedestal. The figure of GANE'S'A is about two feet high, well carved and polished. The tetnple of N AU-DE'vI has been lately ~epaired, and is covered in with a square copper roof. <span class="loc">It</span> 'contains the images of BHAVA'R~ under nine dif- ferent forms, but the whole of them were so-plaster- cd with grease, that no part of the figures 'were visible ; and although the ,doors. were opened, pur- posely for our inspection, the stench that issued ii-om the place was so offensive, as to stifle all far- ther curiosity.

In the commencement of this day's.route; we pass- ed Vishn't~praydga, formed by the junction of the . Akacwnandd with a river called DauR or La'&amp;, which comes from the S. E. and is more considerable than the former, being about thirty-five or forty yards in breadth, and flowing with 'a rapid current, over a very strong bed. Its banks are steep and rocky; and the' passage of the river is effected by a platform <span class="loc">Sangha</span>, about five feet broad, and extending from shore to shore. The Alascznandd, above this con- flulence, is called Vidn'u Gangd, from its flowing near the feet af VISHNU at B'lkudri-Nut'h. It comes from the north. Its breadth is twenty-five or thirty yar&amp;;and its stream js rapid. . ~avi&amp; crosskd'the bridge, we iseenddd a bank of rock, above whish is'.the village of Vishn'ujmzy- 'ctga, containing two or three houses, with a small Mut'ha, the doors of which were shut, and no needy Brdhmea OF Fukir was in attendance, to do the ho- nours of the t&amp;nple, or receive the offerings of the . curious, or religious visitant. This -apparent inat- ;. tention, however, may p,mceed, from its not 'being . 'a place held in great veneration ; for although, in point of magnitude, this Pruyda may be considered . next to Dkuapraydga; no particular ablutions are , here enjoined by the Sltras;*and'the only reason which occurs for the omission is, that there is no convenient place for bathing, on account of the rapi- dity of the two currents. Along the banks of the Dad ie one of the high roads leading to Butdn. . From hence, we began to ascend the scarp, on the E. bank of the Alacanandci; (we shall continue to call it by this name to prevent confusion.) The mountains, on each side, rise to a stupendous height, and nearly meat at their be, leaving only a passage d forty or fifty feet for the current of water. . The bed of the Aver is' obslricted by large masses of rock. At eight o'clock we crossed at he fo6t of a cascade, falling from the height of ninety or a hun- , dred feet ; whence it rolls, over large fragments, into &amp;he river.

Although formidable in appearance, the path was tolerably se- cure ; and, by all accounts, infinitely preferable to the one'formerly pursued, which was higher up the mountain. This road has been newly made by the Gurc'hdlie; and considerable labour has been be- stowed, in bringing .it even to its present passable state. In a quarter of an hour we came upon the bed of the river, covered with large stones, whence we reascended on the bank, and proceeding, over a very indifferent road, for fifteen minutes more,, we arrived at a fl.ight of steps, raised on a Ci~abutra, to the height of thirty feet. In the centre of it was a broad ladder, fihy or sixty feet long, resting on a projecting point of rock. The'materials were strong and good ; but the crowds of people, who were pass- ing up and down, made the scaffolding shake ; and some of the rounds having given way, rendered the passage more difficult. - The roaring noise of the water, together with' the buzz and tumult of the crowd, added not a little to the unpleasantness of the situation ; and the progress upwards was so slow, that a person had full leisure to attend to the sug- gestions of danger, which a rocky precipice of ninety or a hundred feet, would naturally create, under such circumstances. Havi~lg reached the ledge, which was in some places not above-a foot in breadth, we continued a short ascent, by steps, whence we be- gan to descend; and, in 'ten minutes, regained the # regular path on the slope. These are called the Cldri Dlhar and Canda Dha~ GVdts, well known to all travellers on this road. We had heard accounts of them several days before our arrival, and were prepared to encounter their difficul: ties, At 10-40 A. M. we halted for seven minutes, opposite to the Cl'ibaad Ncidi, which falls into the 'Akucanandci on the other side. From hence the road continued, along the .slope, rendered very bad, in SURVEY.

About eteven o'clock, the rain began to fall, in a drizzling shower, and as it continued to increase, we halted, . for half an hour, in a small cave by the side. of the road. After pursuing our route, we arrived, in fif- teen minutes, at a small village called Hdt'. Hence we proceeded, over large stones, near the bed of the river, and, in a few minutes, came opposite to a stream, calIed the Bunctr hTadi, which fqlls into the Alacanandd from the S. E. Immediately above the junction, is a <span class="loc">Sangha</span>, supported on two large frag- ments of rock, about five or six feet above the water. At one o'clock, the rain descended. in a heavy . shower, which continued, with litttle intermission, till the evening. The road of to-day is considered, and justly so, the worst between Srinagar and Blhadri-Nht'h. Al- though great pains have been taken to render it pas- sable, it is still in need of much improvement ; and there are some parts of it, which few people, unac- customed to such passages, could traverse, without feeling some sensation of apprehension. The hills, in general, bore a very barren appearance ; the lower ridges, which were sheltered f~om the winds, were partially covered-with verdure and small trees; while the higher ones produced only a few clumps of the weeping fir. The tops of the mouiitains, to the N. about five or six miles distant, were completely co- vered with snow.

The north faces of themountains, to the south of the river, were completely covered with snow, from the summit to the b'ase ; and the bleak aspect of the country, with .the sharp piercing wind, gave the appearance .and sensation of the depth .of winter, in a myth. more northern latitude. When the suhce of the moun- I tains was paaially disclosed, the soil was of a hard solid.rock ; and excepting at the base, not a vestige of verdure or vegetation was to be.eeen. The breadth- of the valley is about five or six hundred yards ; a 'imall space of it is laid ont in field, but the sides of the mountains are too steep and abrupt to carry .the cultivation beyond fie low ground, and are ac- ceesible only to the sheep and goats, that are seen browzing, a short distance up the 'slope, At twelve oJclocki we reached the extremity of our journey,. opposite to a water-fall called Bars4 Dhctpd.

The small quantity that dissolves, undermines the bed; whence it is- 'sues, in a small stream, about two hundrec! paces - below. This place forms the boundary of the pil- grilh's devotions ; some few come hither for the pur- pose'of being sprinkled by this holy shower bath. From this spot, the direction of the Alucanandd is perceptible to the S. W. extremity of the valley, distant about one mile; but its current is entirely concealed, under immense heaps of snow, which have, most probably been accumulating for ages, in its channel. Beyond this point, travellers have not dared to venture; and, although the Sdstras mention a place called Alacapzira,* whence the river derives its source and name, the position or existence of it is as' much obscured in doubt and fable, as every other part , - of their mythological history. Having now attained the limits prescribed for Lieu t. WERE' s inquiries in this direction, we com- menced our return, and proceeded by the road which leads to the town of Mdndb. In an hour and a half we arrived at Caldpa OrLn, the beauties of which were not perceptible from the opposite side of the river. From the summit of this hill, a large stream, called the Sarasloati Nadl, appears to force a passage, through a rocky cavern ; whence it descends, 'with irresistible violence, in a solid compact body, dis-' closed to the height of forty or fifty feet.

From hence, the stream flows in a gentle current, between two per- pendicular rocky banks, about seventy or eighty feet in height, and twenty feet in width. The water is perfectly clear, of a beautiful ultramarine colour ; which it retains for a considerable distance, after its union with the.

The passage over the <span class="loc">Suras</span>- quati is by a bridge, formed of one entire piece of - rock, about six feet in thickness, ten or twelve in breadth, and so exactly fitted to the width of the stream, as to have.the appearance of being placed by the hands of mechanism ; and, notwithstanding the assertions of our guides, we could hardly believe its . positipn to have been accidental. Thi~~place goes by the name of Manstila Htd. Hence we ascended the bank leading to the town, situated a little above the confluence of the two streams. On the left of the road, are twd or three rocks, in the cavities of which small temples are erected. Of these, the. Gandsa Aaatcir is the most conspicuous, more from . its position than from the structure of the temple, which is about five feet high, and built of- square stones, piled one above the other, decreasing towards- the top. I.t stands in a large cavern, close to which a small stream comes rippling from the mountain. i The town of MdnaR is built in three divisions, containing one hundred and fifty or two hundred houses, and is more populous than any place we have met with of the same extent. The number of j ts inhabitants is computed at fourteen or fifteen hun- dred people ; who appear to be of a different race from 1 4 -- . . + 0 " 7 I % , 'T . 396 I ' SURVEY OF THE GANGES.

Thefare above the middling size, stout, well formed, and their' . countenances partake more of the features of the- Turturs or Bzitiiis, from whom they they are most, pmbably descended. Thejr have broad faces, smdl eyes, and con~plexion~ of a light olive colour. As soon as we entered the taws all the inhabit- ants came out, to welcome us ; and we obsetved a greater display of female and juvenile beauty,' than we recollect to have seen in any Indian village. The women were, in general, handsome, and had a ruddiness in their complexions, of which the chil- dren in a very great degree ; many uf the*. approaching to the floridness' of the European. The , dress of the two sexes differs little from each other ; L that of the men consists in a. pair of trowers, made of <span class="loc">Cammal</span> or <span class="loc">Panc</span>'ild, with a loose sIeeved jacket, I of the same cloth, reaching down to the knee, and bound round the waist, with a woollen cord. On. their heads they wore a round cap, with flaps, turned ' up behind and in front, with a cloth edging of a dif- . ferent colour. The women, instead of trowsqs, wear a wrapper, in the form of a petticoat ; the upper gar- ment is nearly the same with that of the qen ; but: rather finer in teltture, and of different colours, of which red appeared the fakouri te and predominant. $ome of them wear small conical caps, others have a piece of cloth round the head, in the shape of a' turban. Their.necks, ears, and noses, =re coirered with a profusion of rings, various ornaments of beads, with trinkets .in gold and silver, little adapted td ' their appearance, or to the coarseness of tb pst of their apparel. Some of the children were actually tottering under the weight of these costly 'burthens r ' bea~ing, on their nekkg'and arms, silver necklaces and rings, to the amount of five or six hundred ru- peers.

Towards the latter end of July, when the snow has melted, and opened a passage over the mountains, these people set off, in parties of a hundred or a hundred and fifty together, with merchandize, but principally grain, laden upon sheep and goats. In exchange, they bring back the . produce of Bzitcin, for which the annual pilgrimage' ensures them a certain and advantageous sale. In this . traffic, many of them acquire very large fortunes; and there was then present a young man, who was offering a few articles of small value for sale, whose grand-father, as we were informed, had, on one oc- casion, come forward with a loan of two lakh of . fupees, to assist the <span class="loc">Raja</span> of S~inugar in the first .

A few articla of porcelaiil ?re also brought down ; but the demand for them is small, as also for tea, of which they import only the quaytity required for their own private consumption.

Of the latter we saw several grazing in the valley. It is about the size of a common buffaloe, but the head has a great resemblance to that of the ox. The ears are small, the horns long, curved inwardly, with a little out- ward bend at the point. The forehead and hump are covered with a kind of wool ; from the shoulder to the knee, and along the flanks in a line with the lower ribs, also from tbe haunches, the hair falls, lank and straight, to the length of ten or twelve inches. The tail, which is the inost singular part, is set on like that of a horse, and the long hair commences from the upper joint. This animal is considered very strong c #and hardy. The people of.MdnuA make use of them both for carriage and for riding. They are of different colours, but the black appear to be the most common. Dogs are also brought down by these people ; and two or three very fine. ones were offered to us for sale. One of them was a remarkably fine animal, as large as a good sized Newfoundland dog, with very long hair, and a head resembling a mastiff's. His tail was of an amazing length, like the brush of a fox, and qrled half way over his back. He was however so fierce, that he would allow no stranger to approach him ; and the same fault was observable in the rest of this species.

But more probabv east. SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 53 1 which we had received an invitation from the high priest. e 31st. Therrn. 46. This morning was set apart for the visit to the temple, to which we proceeded be- fore breakhst, having got intimation from the Rauhil that every thing was arranged for our reception. The town and temple of Bhad~i-Nat'h are situated on the mest bank of tl&amp; Alacandndd, in the centre of a valley, about four miles in length, and one mile in its greatest breadth. The east bank ri es consi- S derably higher than the west bank ; and is on a level with the top of the temple. The position of the sanc- tuary is considered equididtant from two lofty moun- tains, which are designated by the names of the <span class="loc">Nar</span> and Nrirdym Paruutus. The former is to the east, and is perfectly bare ; the latter to the wrest, and com- pletely covmd with snow, from the summit to the base. The town is built on the sloping bank of the river, and contains only twenty or thirty huts, for the ac- commdation of the Brdhmens, and other attendants of the deity. In the centre, is a flight of steps, lead- ing from the water's edge, to the temple, which oc- cupiea the upper part of the hwn. The structure and appearance of this ddifice are by no means an- swerable to the expectations that might be. formed of a paace of such reputed sanctity, and for the sup- port of which large sums are annually received, in- , dependent of the land revenues appropriated for its maintenance. It is built in the form of a cone, with a small cupola, surmounted by a square shelving roof, of plates of copper, over which is a golden ball and spire. The he~ght of the building is not above forty or fifty feet ; but its advantageous position, on the top of the bank, renders it the most conspicuous object in &amp;e valley. The aera of its foundation is too M#M 2 532 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. remote to have reached us, even by tradition; but if is supposed to be the work of some superior being. This specimen, however, of divine architecture, was too weak to resist the shock of theearthquake, which * left it in so tottering a condition, that human efforts were judged expedient, to preserve it from ruin; and the repairs, which it has lately undergone, have com- pletely modernized its external appearance. The body of it is constructed of large oat stones, over which is a coat of fine white plaister,'-which adds to the neat- ness, but has destroyed all its outward pretensions to 'antiquity. I- Notwithstanding the summons, we were not al- lowed immediate access to the temple ; as it was first necessary to haye an interview with the Rauhid, who was to introduce us, in due form, into the presence of the sacred image. Instead, therefore, of ascend- ing, we went down the steps, leading to the baths. About the middle of the bank is a large cistern, about twenty or thirty feet square, covered in with a slop- ing roof of deal planks, supported on wooden posts. This is called Tapta-Czind, and is a warm bath, sup- plied by aspring of hot water, issuing from the moun- tain, by a subterraneous passage, and conducted to the cistern, through a small spout, representing a dragon's or a griffin's head. Close to it is a cold spring, which is conveyed by another spout; by which means, the water may be reduced to any de- dree of temperature, between the two extremes. The water of the Tapfa-Czind it as hot as a person can well bear ; and from it issues a thick smoke, or steam, strongly tainted with a sulphurous smell. The side of the cistern, towards the river, is raised only to the height of three and a half or four feet; and over it, the water flows, as the supplies are received from ;he opposite quarter. This is the principal bath, in which people of both sexes perform their ablutions, under the same roof; without coilsidering any pf tition ne- e b 5 1 1 I I SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 533 cessary,. to preserve the appearance of decency. The water from this Ctind, independent of its supplying the cistern, is conducted through the huts and private houses, to which it imparts a s'uffocating warmth. From hence, we descended to the bed of the river, where, in a small recess of the bank, is Ndreda-Cind, sheltered by a large rock, whose projecting angle breaks the force of the current. A little to the left of it is Szirya-Czind, another hot spring, issuing, in a very small stream, through a fissure in the bank. There is no bason, or reservoir, to receive the water ; but the pilgrims catch it in their hands as it falls, and sprinkle themselves over with it. This ceremony is observed, as much for comfort, as from any motive of piety ; for the water of the river is so cold, at this season, that after performing their frigid ablutions, the bathers are glad to have recourse to the element in a more tepid state. Besides these, there are nu- merous other springs, which have their' peculiar names and virtues; which are, no doubt, turned to a good account by the Brcihmens. In going the round of purification, athe poor pilgrim finds his purse lessen, as his si s decrease; and the numerous tolls, that %- are levie on this high road to paradise, may induce him to think, that the straightest path is not the least 2xpensive. As we ascended the steps, the arrival of the <span class="loc">Rau</span>- Tail was announced. We met him near the Tapta- Czind, where a cloth was spread for us, and a small :arpet of flowered <span class="loc">China</span> silk fir the pontiff. He was o~ceded by three or four Harcci~uhs and Chobdci~s, Lvi th the silver emblems of their office ; behind him was a man bearing a <span class="loc">Chauri</span> of peacock's feathers; xnd in his suite were the chief officiating priests of :he temple. He was dressed in a quilted vest, of ween satin, with a white shawl Camerband. On his 7 nead he wore a red turban, and on his feet a pair of M Bi 3 party coloured socks ; his ears were ornamerlted with a'couple of large qolclen rings ; to each of which was suspended a very handsome pearl, of considerable size. His neck was decorated with a triple string of small pearls ; and, round his arms, he wore bracelets, ~ composed of precious stones. On most of his fingers \ were golden rings, studded with sparkling gems. After the usual salutations, a short conversation passed, for about a quarter of a hour ; when he sig- nified his readin~ss to conduct us to the sanctuary. On our arrival at the outer portico, we were request- ed to take off our shoes ; and having done so, we as- cended fivc or six steps, and passed through a small door, which brought us to the area of the temple. About twenty feet beyond, was R vestibule, raised about a foot and a half from th~ terrace, and divided into two apartments, the inner one a little more ele- vated, and adjoining to the sanctuary. In the outer room, two or three bells were suspended from the roof, for the use of the religious visitanp, who are I not permitted to go beyond it. We were not al- lowed to advance so far; but taking. our stand im- mediately in front of the image, a few paw from the outer threshold, we had a perspective vlew of the sacred repository. The high priest retired to one side, as the dress he then wore was incompatible with his sacred functions. The principal idol, Bhodri- ~ Nbt'h, was placcd opposite to the door, at the far- ~ ther extremity; above his head was a small looking- glass, which reflected the objects from the outside : i in front of him were ho or three lamps, (which were all the light the apartment received, excepting fr6m the door) diffusing such feeble glimmering rays, that nothing was clearly distinguished. He was dressed h a suit of old and silver brocade ; below him was 1 a table, or % oard, covered with the same kind of cloth, which, glittering through the gloom, might impress the beholder with the idea of splendor and magniqcence; but an impartial observer might sup- pose it one of those deceptions of priest-craft, which are so successfully practised on the Hindu. This artificial obscurity may have the double effect of passing off tinsel and glass, for gold and precious stones; and, by exhibiting the image in a dubious light, the superstitious mind has a greater scope for its own conceptions. From the indistinct view we had of it, we should suppose it to be about three feet high, cut in black stone, or marble ; but the head and hands were the only parts uncovered. To the right of him, are the images of UDD'<span class="loc">HAVA</span>, <span class="loc">NAR</span> and <span class="loc">NARA</span>'YENA ; to the left, <span class="loc">CUVE</span>'RA and NA'REDA, with whom we were only nominally acquainted ; for to us they were veiled, as ministers of perfecs darkne'ss. Having satisfied our curiosity, and signified our wish to depart, a large silver salver was brought forth, to receive any offering we were inclined to make. Our means were very insufficient, to answer the high expectations which had undoubtedly been, formed, from the marked and unprecedented distinction that had been conferred upon us; but, as it was necessary . to acknowledge the favour by some pecuniary token, we presented one hundred rupees at the shrine, and took our leave, without absolution or remission. <span class="loc">Alt</span> though we derived little gratification from the in- spection of the temple, it <span class="loc">Ivas</span> pleasing to find we had not offended any of their religious prejudices, by our presence ; for we mere apprehensive some scruples or objectious might have been r&amp;d, as none but Hh- dvis have ever visited the place. Our ,Mzcolesn&amp;ser- vants were prohibited from approaching the spot ; and a particular request was made, 0x1 our arrival, that no kid or living creature might be deprived of life, within the precincts of the temple ; but a large stone, on the opposite side of the river, at a short distance from our camp, was pointed out, far the MM4 536 SURVEY OF THB GAKGES. slaughter of any animals we might require fot the table. The temple of Bhadri-Ndt'lh has more beneficed lands attached to it, than'any sacred Hindu esta- blishment in this part of lizdia. It is said to possess seven hundred villages, situated in different parts of Gerzvcil and Camn'ul~'. Many of them have been con- ferred by the government ; ' others have been given in pledge for loans ; and some few, purchased by indi- viduals, have been presented as religious offerings. All these possessions are under the jurisdiction of the high priest ; who holds a paramount authority, no- rr~inally independent, of the ruling power. The ad- vantages, which the government derives, fro111 this institution, would make it cautious in infringing openly its rights ; while the accumulation of wealth, secures to the state, a certain resource in times of exigence. The Rajas of Srinagur were in the habit of appIy- ing to this quarter, in any case of emergency ; and, under the plea of borrowing a s~m of money, would give up two or three villages, as security for the re- payment ; but the produce of them was so inferior, in value, to the sum lent, that the loan was never repaid, and the villages continued under pledge. Thus the appearance of independence was maintain- ed,,on the part of the Rauhil, who was so well aware of his actual weakness, that; it was more for his ad- vantage- to yield to a request, than subject himself to the risk'of compulsion. The selection for the ofice of high priest is confined to the casts of Dekl~z'ni Br&amp;l~tnens of the CAauli or Nasnburi tribes. In for- . mer times, the situation was a permanent one ; but, ' since the Gurc'hdli conquest, the pontificate is held up for sale, and disposed of to the highest bidder. All the villages belonging to Bhadri-Ndt'h, SGRVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 537 which we'had an opportunity of seeinq, were in a very flourishing condition; and the larids in a high ' state of cultivation. The produce is brought hither, and disposed of to the pilgrims, who are obliged to pay dearly for the food furnished from the ecclesias- tical granary. Two and a half skrs of rice, for the Temcisl~a, equal to about seven sirs for the rupee, was the established price of this market; and other grain in the same proportion. These exactions do not escape observation ; numerous complaints are vented privately ; but, as the profits are supposed to be ap- plied to the use of the divinity, it might be deemed impious to raise any open clamours : the only re- source, therefore, left to the deluded pilgrim, is. to pay his devotions, and take his departure as quickly as possible. The territorial revenue forms, probably, the least part of the riches of this establishment; for every person, who pays his homage to the deity, is ex- pected to make offerings, proportionate to his means. The gift is included under three heads; for each of which a separate salver is allotted. The first is called the Rldt, which is an offering to the idol ; the second is the Bldg, constituting his privy purse, the amount being appropriated to the expences of his wardrobe and table ; the third, and last, is for the Ruuhtl. These yresents, however, are voluntary ; and many persons assume the garb of poverty, to avoid a con- trwtion equal to their abilities ; while others lay the whole of their property at the feet of the idol, and trust to charity, for the means of returning to their homes. It is impossible to form a conjecture of the pro- bable amount of these collections; for, although every person's name, with the sum presented, be register- ed, the book is withheld from the inspection of pro- fane eyes. The merchants and Sdhucdra from the Dekhiw, are considered the most welcome visitors ; 538 SURVEY OF THBl GANGEB. fbr, if we may believe report, many of them have been known to distribute and expend dakhs of rupees, in this holy pilgrimage. Ira return for the oblations, each person receives what is called a Presa'd, which consists of a little I I boiltd rice ; and in the distribution of it, due regard is paid to tbe amount of the ogering. Many of our Hindu servants complained that they had been used very scurvily, having been put off with a very scanty meal, insufficient to satisfy the cra~inp of appetite. However sparing the dispensation of his favours may be in this world, ths deity holds forth ample rewards in the next, by the.promise of an unqualified remis- a aion from the state of transmigration. As we were not entitled to the same act of grace, the hiah priest appeared desirous to make amends, by conferring more immediate bendits; and, in the evening, sent to each of us.a muslin turban, a GaxggbE, and a small quantity of Cddrpati, an odoriferous leaf, &gt;taken from the gadand of the idol. The former was stained, in la~ge spots, of a saffron colour, with the incense placed on the liead of the deity ; and we were re- qumted to wear them, in honour of BH A DRI-NA'T'H. This is considered ope of the greatest marks of dis- tinction, that can be c~nferred ; and, as a aompli- ment was inteuded, we could not do less than ac- knowledge the favour, by .placing the sacred badge upon our heads., 4. # The temple is #opened, every mrniq, at day- break, and continues expmed, for the admission of pilgrims, till one or two o'clock in the afternoon+ the deity is then supposed to be ready for his dinner, I which b 'ng pepare$ ,f~r him, he is shut up, to take I hk mea lU and evening repose. The doors are again opened after suw-sat, and remain so till a late hour, whem a bed is laid out before him, and he is again I left to h&amp; meditations. The vessels he is served in are of gdd and silver ; and the expences of his i SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 539 clothes and table, are said to be very considerable. A large establishment of servants, of every descrip- tion, is kept up; and, during the months of pil- grimage, tho deity is well clothed, and tsres sump- tuously every day; but, as soon as the winter com- mences, the priests take their departure, deavinq him to provide for his own wants, until the periodical re- turn of the holy season. The treasures, and val~~able rltensils, are buried in a vault, under the temple. It is said that a robbery was once co~nrnitted by o few mountaineers ; who, taking zdvantage of a s~~dden thaw found their way to the sanctuary, and carried off efeven rnaunds of gold and silver vessels. The theft, however, was discovered, and the perpetrators put to death. The only persons who have aacess to the inner apartments, are the servants of the temple ; and none but the Rauhil is permitted to touch the image. The Rrdhtmns who reside here, are chiefly men from the Deklbin, who have been led hi thr by the prospect of acquiring a subsistence &amp;om the funds of the temple, and from the emdl fees or do- nations presented by the pilgrims. As they all arrive in a state &amp;f celibacy, coionization is prevented, by the insuperable obstacle of there being no women here of their own cast, with whom they could form a lawful alliance. During their residence at this place, they are most strictly enjoined to maintain a state of carnal purity; but on their return to Jisi- nzut'lha, they give a greater scope to their pleasures ; and the above restrictions map probably be the cause of their running more eagerly into acts of prpfligacy, very inconsistent with the sace&amp;otal character. OUT Short acquaintance would have enabled us to gain very little insight into their moral conduct, had-not the hopes of relief induced several-of the9 to make a confession of coinplaints they laboured under. NA- RA'YEN A RAG, the present Ravltil, is a ma abou* thirty-two or thirty-three years of age; his appoint- ment was conferred on him by an order from Nccpdl; not, we presume, on .account of exemplary ccmhct, 540 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. for he was the first who applied for remedies to cure a certain unaccountable disorder, with which he had lo~ig been troubled, and which he innocently ascribed to the rarefaction of the atmosphere ; but it was suf- ficiently evident, that the shrine of his deity was not the only one at which he had been paying his devotion. The number of pilgrims who have visited Bhadri- Ndt'h this year, is calculated at forty-five or fifty thousand; the greater part of these, Fakirs, who came from the most remote quarters of <span class="loc">India</span>. All these people assemble at Haridtadr ; and, as sob as the fair is concluded, take their departure for the holy land; the road they follow is by Dkva rayaga to d Rudapraydga; whence they strike o to Ckddr- <span class="loc">Nat</span>'h. This place is situated about fourteen or fif- teen miles in direct distance to the W. N. W. of Bhadri-Ndt'h, but the intermediate hills are inacces- sible from the snow ; and the travellers are obliged to make a circuitous route, of eight or nine days, by the way of Jbsi-snat'ha, hither. The road to Ckddr , ea s over is much obstructed ; and, in many places* 1 d beds of snow, extending for several miles. Two or three hundred people are said to have perished this year, on the journey; having fallen victims to the inclemency of this climate, and the fatigues they had to undergo. By the time the pilgrimage to Cdda'r-Ndt'h is com- pleted, Bhudri-Ndt'h is ready to receive visitors; who, hiving paid their devotions, return by the road - of Ndndpraydga and Carnpraydgci, which conclude the grand circle of pilgrimage. The cerkonies w&amp;ch Hindus undergo here, differ in no respect from the customs usually observed at other places of holy ablution. After washing away their impurities, the men whose fathers are dead, and those of the female sex who are widows, submit to SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 54 1 the operation of tonsure, which may be considered an act of mourning and of purification; by which they are rendered perfect to appear in the presence of the deity. One day sufficp for the observance of these rites ; and very few peoile remain here above a couple of days, but endeavour to make their retreat from the hills, before the commencement of the pe- riodical rains. The great crowd had quitted it before our arrival; and the number who now come in daily, does not probably exceed forty or fifty. By the mid- dle of June, the lowlanders will have taken their departure, leaving the place to its mountaineer inha- bitants, and a few stragglers from the southward. 1. June 1st: Therm 47'. We commenced our return, with the intention of proceeding, by the way of AG qnora, to Bu~kli; and encamped on our former ground at <span class="loc">Panc</span>'hkser. Bd. Therm. 61'. Marched to' Jhsi-mat'h. Soon after our arrival at this place, the Harcdrah, who had overtaken us at Ndndapraydga, again made his ap- pearance, with a letter from SHISTA TAPAH, ad- dressed to H AR-B A LAM, an intelligent Bra'htnen, a native of Camdijn, who had accompanied us from Huridtadr, and who had been of great service to us in our trip. The purport was, to state, that the or- ders of the government of 2Vupcil were merely t;o faci- litate our visit to Ganghtri; but that no instructions had been received for our going to Rhadri-Ndt'h; that we had updertaken that journey by the Brdh- ,men's instigation, and that he must become respon- sitlle for any accidents which we might meet with on -the road. It concluded with di~ctions, that at whatever place he might receive the letter, he should conduct us from thence, by the way of Al- mora, towards the Company's provinces. This was the result of a political jealousy, which the chiefs hatl conceived, of the purpose of our journey; which * 342 SURVEY OW THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. they began to suspect to he of a political as well as a geographical nature. It was expected that the letter would overtake us before we could reach our ultimate object, and prevent vr farther advance; but the messenger, on his arrival here, learning that we had got to the end of our journey, thought it best to wait our return. 3d. . As soon as we. awoke this morning, we were surprised to learn the desertion of all our bearers and hired servants; which we knew could not have taken place, without. the connivance or express order of the Srinagar goyrnment. We were, therefore, , under the necessity of proceeding on foot, to the, next stage, leaving our baggage to the care of the Gwrc'hdli Jemadar, INTE A-RA N A GUR A NG, who, having received a sealed perzercinah, to provide us with every thing we might require on the road, and to escort us to AIutora, and having got no mes- sage, or counter order, declared that no part of our baggage should remain in the rear; but that we might commence our march, in the manner we pro- posed, and firmly rely upon his procuring people to bring up the whole of our property, This morning the Therm. was at 66'. Marched , to the village of fmgcisi, above which we encamp- ed in some sno&amp; rice fields. I . On this dafs route we passed through a very ex- tensive fosest, where we were agreeably amused with a great variety of vegetable productions, some of which we had not met with in any other part of the hills. .The firet ob~ect that particularly attracted ovr notioe, was a fruit resembling the huxel, the produce of a forest tree, growing to the height of fifty or sixty feet, with a trunk of six or seven tht in cir- cumference. The hraxlches are thrown out, about mid-way up the atem. The fruit ripens in the month of SepterrlNr ; and, by the accounts of the hill peo- SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 543 1 ple, is only produced every third year. It is called C,upaishi or Pahdd Bdddm. The PUW~WT, or home chsnut, is another ornament of this forest ; and ap- pean, at this season, to the greatest advantage, be- ing in full blossom. Thk fruit of this tree is frequently worn by Fakirs, in strings, round the neck ; it is given by the hill people to fatten cattle; and the lower classes sometimes make use of it as an article of food, by reducing the nut to powder, and steeping it in gater, till the bitter ta$te is in some measure extracted. We observed here also several bushes of holly, which the nativee call <span class="loc">Kundal</span>. The walnut trees were very abundant ; the fruit of them had at- tained its full size, and the kernel had begun to ac- quire a consistence. Along the sides of the road, particularly in the vicinity af rivulets, were great numbers of the <span class="loc">Bambu</span> reed called Ri~qal. Some of them grew to a tapering height, of thirty or thirty- five feet; and are used by the inhabitants, in the thatching of houses and for mats. The soil of these hills was various ; in some parts clayey, in others gravelly ; but in general, of a fine rich earth, producing plants and flowers, too numer- ous to be minutely examined or described. We met with a few plants of asparagus and wild lavender; but the strawberries more particularly engaged our attention. They were dispersed in large beds, in the greatest profusion ; and the species found here differ- ed fron~ the common kind, being much la~ger, strangly dimpled, and of a mottled colour, white and red. The natives to the westward call the strawberry Cap'htcl- %a, but in these hills it is known by the name of <span class="loc">Boinda</span>. The flavour of those tve found to-day was very superior to any ,we had yet tasted; many of them fell little short of the <span class="loc">Europe</span> fruit. The Gurc'hdli Jmmdar proved true to his word ; for in the evenkg he arrived with a1l.our baggage. 54.4 SURVEY OF THE GAKGES. 4th. Therm. 57". Marched to Panhai, a large vil- lage, containing fifty or sixty houses, and situated about mid-way up the hill, in a large indented scoop of the mountain, in which several other small villages are disposed ; and the adjaceht lands well cultivated. The march to-day is calculated at twelve hill, Chs, and could not be less than thirteen or fourteen miles, The badness and inequalities of the road rendered the journey very fatiguing, and the greater the baggage remained in the rear. part Of The forests, through which we passed this day, abounded in hazel, walnut, and horse chesnut trees; while the upper part of the mountains were covered with a different species of the fir, called De'odcir. Among the productions of this forest was a species of oak, called Khairzi. The leaves oval, firm and in- dented, the young ones only pointed, of a bright glossy green above, and rather lighter below. The stem rises straight, to a considerable height before it I branches. The acorns are now ripe, and of an amaz- ing size ; some of them as large, and in the form of, a pigeon's egg. The trunk and branches covered with a thick moss. Some of these trees attain the height of sixt or seventy feet. The acorns are given to cattle. d ere we saw for the first time the Bhhj- patr tree. The leaf is about two inches long, oval and sawed. The back of the stem, in young trees, I is smooth and glossy, of a light chocolate colour, speckled with small white spots. As the tree grows up, the bark acquires a greyish hue, and becomes hard and scabrous, cracking or dividing into small. I pieces. Below are five or six inner coats or rind;, which come off in sheets, and are the parts used by the natives as paper, and in the manufacture of Hooka snakes. When unprotected by the outer bark, these coats peel off in shivers, giving a very ragged tattered appearance to the tree. The small twigs are of the colour and resemble birch. If . SURVEY OF THE. GAPGES. 545 we may trust to the reports of the natives, the tree, if stript of these integuments, renews them in the course of one or two seasons. The tree grows to - the height of thirty or forty feet, and the branches are-thrown out about mid-way up the stem. The ! largest we saw measured about foui- feet in circum- ference. 'In the vicinity of these trees were several currant bushes, just passing from the blossom into a state of fructification. The natives say it is of the red species, and the name they give to it is Cucali'a. . A large colony of baboons, called Luna&amp;rs, have taken up their residence in the centre of the forest. They appeared very attentive to all our motions, and , some of them had the temerity to advance within a few paces of us. Among the flowery productions, we met with a very handsome, shrub, called by the hill people Chimila. It produces a head or cluster of bell flowers, similar in size and shape to the <span class="loc">Bzi</span>- rcins. The leaves are lance-oval, firm, .of a dark green above, and of a deep yellow ochroris colour. The stem quite naked, running along the ground, like a creeper, for the distance of ten or fifteen feet; when, taking a bend upwards, it rises to the hei ht of eight or ten feet, and throws out branches. # he flowers were of different colours, varying, from pure white, with all the intermediate shades, to a dark purple. The examination of these novelties served to beguile the toilsome road ; and we were led on from point to point, witH the pleasing hope of having our labour' and fatigues rewarded by some new or beautiful pro- duction of vegetative nature. ' . ' After quitting these forests, we as'cended, bver beds of snow, to .the summit of the Cwdrt G'lta't, which is a regular steep ascent, of not less than four and a half or five miles ; whence we may estimate that its height above our last encampment (which was itself a considerable elevation from the valley) , must be ei ht or nine thousand feet perpendicular. YO:. ~f. N N 5C6 SURVEY 'OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. The ~and~r, or hill pheasants, are. found in great numbers among these hills; but they keep near the summits, and seldom visit the vallies, ur~less driven down by heavy falls of snow. The mo* the natives adopt to catch them is by springs, wit4 which they , sometimes succeed in taking them alive. The hill people put great value on their feathers, which they preserve with the skin entire. They sometimes make them up into small hand -fans; and we have seen little tufts made up into a knot, worn as an orna- ment to a greasy cap. 5th. Therm. 61'. As many of our people were still in the rear, and those who had arrived were ex- tremely fatigued by yesterday's march, we were obliged to halt, very much against our inclination ; for the weather became more cloudy daily, portend- ing what we had so much cause to apprehend, the commencement' of the rainy reason. About five o'clock came on a violent shower, attended by thun- der and lightning, which lasted for several hours. 6th. Therm. 56'; and weather cloudy. Marched to <span class="loc">Rame</span>'nz', and encamped in a small field near it, between two rivulets. The road this day lay through extensive forests of oak, holly, horse chesnut and fir (Dkoddr.) The latter diff'ered in its foliage from the species we had before seen. The leaves are about one and an half or two inches in length, flat, sharply pointed, and produced horizontally on each side of the twig. The bar&amp; more smooth, and the stem rises to the heighx of seventy or eighty feet, with a, circumference of seveil or eight cubits. This species acquires greater dimensions than any,pf'the firs we have yet met with. The natives call it also Dkoddr, which is a name they indiscriminately apply to all the different kinds, 'without, having any partjcular name descriptive of SURVEY OP THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 547 e each. Since we quitted the neighbourhood of Bhadri- Ndt'h, we have seen none of the drooping species, and these hills appear peculiarly favodrable to the kind above described. The otherspecies, which pro- I ducesfthe leaves in tufts, and rises in the form of a cone, is to be found in most parts af the mountain, beyond the limits to which the common CACr extends. . ? We passed two steep summits, called the Cdla- Cdnhand Janic'hi Ghdts, between which lay a quarry of very fine marble. Near the road were several beautiful white slabs, twelve or *fourteen feet in length, arld three or four in thickness. We found the insects at this place extremely trou- blesome. The atmosphere swarmed with myriads of small flies, resembling gnats, the attacks of which it was impossible to guard against, and the sting was ex- ceedingly sharp and painful. On the road we had another formidable enemy to encounter, which was a numerous host of small leeches, brought by the rain, and,infesting the path, to the great annoyance of travellers. We found that our shoes and stockings were not- proof against their attacks ; for by some means or other, they found their way to the skin ; and our attendants, who were undefended in their feet and legs, arrived in streaks of blood, having their lower limbs completely covered with this noisome reptile. 7th. Therm. 59'. Marched to Kh&amp;nbaghar, a vil- lge containing twenty or thirty houses, and situated on a bank twenty feet high; below which we en- camped. Lat 30' 16' 34" N. ,The road lay through forests, and we crossed two G'hdts or passes of the hills. . We passed in si~ht of the Ndnddcni river, cqlled here Rziret-ca-gdd, a large stream which joins the Alucannndci at Nnndaprycjga. NN2 '56s SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. The inhabitants of this place came forward imrne- diately with supplies, and offered their services, to convey our bag3age to the limits of the Gerwdl dis- trict, at a very reasonable rate. We were happy in the opportunity of forming an arrangement that would make us independent of the precarious assistance to which we had daily to trust; and we entertained as many as we thought would be necessary. As the Jemaddr had remained behind at Panhai, for the purpose of bringing up part of our baggage, which had not reached that place when we' marched from it, we determined to wait his arrival, that so we might proceed w:th all our baggage. But, next morning, ' we were surprised to find the village entirely desert- ed ; owing to the arrival of two Sipdhis from Srina- gar, with, another letter from SHISTA TAPAH to HAR-BALAM, and a message to the Jemuddr. Both of those persons being absent, we sent for the mes- sengers ; one of whom, on being interrogated respect- . ing the object of their message, replied, in the most insolent manner, that his business lay with the Je- maddr, and that the only message he had for us was contained in the orders he had received from his master to bring us back. When HAR-BALAIYT ar- rived, he, with no little agitation, explained the pur- port of the letter, which was an injunction to con- duct us back by the way of Srlnagar, on peril of severe punishment if he disobeyed. , Independently of our personal safety, which we now had reason to think would be endangered by compliance with, this mandate, we were so far ad- vanced on the road to Alwhlra, that it would h&amp;e been extremely inconveni,ent. to adopt the circuitous route of Srinag-ar. We determined to halt this day, in hopes of assistance from the Jemaddr, for the con.- veyance of our baggage ;. for, since the arrival of the two <span class="loc">Sipu</span>'his, oone. of the inhabitants durst afford us the smallest aid. L SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 549 - 9th. Them. 67. Our friend the Jemaddr not hav- ing yet arrived, though we heud from his son, who joined us the preceding evening, that he was still employed in efforts to bring up our baggage; we packed up as many of the most necessary articles as our private servants could convey, and proceeded on our march, leaving a second division of-our baggage, under charge of the two Gurc'hdlb .SiprE&amp;s, who con- tinued to exert their prohibitory autholrity. We took up our quarters under a small tree, opposite to B4nj- baghar, 'a village situated on the bank of a river called Chupkla,* and elevated about four hundred feet above streakn. This evening the Jemadcir arrived, bringing the whole of our baggage, and accompanied by the Gurc- '?bdli Sipcihis, who had obstructed, as far as in them lay, his friendly exertions to serve us. Our friend the Je~nada'r, with a countenailce ex- piessive of his mind, confirmed the unwelcome tidings of his own recal. In delivering up the property, the tear started in his eye, while he expressed his sorrow and regret, for the circumstances that had occurred ; but, said he, " I am like you, a soldier, the servant of a government, and bound to obey the instructions of my masters, without inquiring into the motives of their conduct. My orders to return are positive ; cb and although they are not conveyed in the form I " might have expected, to refuse compliance would " subject me to disgrace and punishment. I consider " it peculiarly unfortunate, that such events should "have occurred, on the eve of your departure ; as I '' had every wish and hope to conduct you, with cod- " fort and satisfaction, to the end of the journey; cC but as the case now stands, I must, however un- " willing, bid you adieu." We gave full credit to * Is it this &amp;ich gives name to the strait of.,Copele in the old maps ? NNS 5% SURVEY. OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. his words; fa he was a plain open man, and his countenance pourtrayed the picture of honesty and frankness. On taking leave of him, we made him a present, which probably exceeded his expectations, but was very inadequate to the services he had ren- dered us ; for, without his.and his son's assistance, we should have had but very indifferent fare, during our journey; all the other Gurc'ha'li Sipdhz's being more intent'= slily plundering the villagers, than providing for our ,wants. However long the march might be, pnd at whatever, hour we arrived at the ground, one of these two immediately set off in search of kids or fowl6 ; and was frequently obliged to visit all the villages, for two or three miles round, before he could succeed. We were certain, however, of being supplied ; for they never came back without some token of their diligence; although they were frequently detained in the pursuit till midnight. Nor was this trouble taken in the expectation of a reward; ' for modesty appeared the most distinguished mark in the character of the father and the son. While the other Gurc'hdli- Sipdhis committed acts of oppres- sion, and endeavoured to thrust themselves into no- tice on every occasion, without doing us any mate- rial service, ' these two peoplelrept constantly aloof, performing real good, without arrogating any merit to themselves. In noticing the conduct of these men, we perform a grateful part of our duty ; and we may *adduce them, as the only instances we have met with, under the Gurc'hdli government, where duty was cheerfully executed, and ready assistance grant- ed, unactuated by any mercenary or self-interesbd views. . 10th. Therm. 68'. The night stormy, and the morning set in with a heavy rain. Aware of the Si- pdltb' endeavours to obstruct our march, we had taken the precaution to detain, under a yuard of our own Si@~is, eight of the people, who had arrived. , SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 55 1 - the evening before, with the Jemaddr. To .these, , and the four who had contisued with us from Jhsi- mutlh, we committed the articles most essentially necessary to our comfort ; and, leaving the remain- der of our baggage, proceeded along the banks of the C?~ttpkla, and over an ascent called Sancbt-Gi~dt, through a forest of <span class="loc">Atis</span>, Ytr'ngar and oak, to the vil- lage of Sanclt, a village of forty or fifty houses, beau- tifully situated on the top of a gentle eminence, in the midst of a circular table ledge, about one mile in . diameter. Lat. 30° 10' 16". The inhabitants were friendly, and came forward with supplies of every kind, on moderate terms. The lands in the vicinity of the village, and the sides of the hill, were richly cultivated ; producing different kinds of grain. It belongs to the Rudkdr Perganah, which was formerly under the charge of M~HEN-SINH, the D61cccin of the <span class="loc">Raja</span>, and was par- ticularly famed for the fertility of its soil. A direct intercouse was, at one time, carried on with the I Butiyas, who came hither, to purchase grain, which they found cheaper, and in greater abundance, than at most of the other markets. 111 exchange for it, a they brought the produce and manufactures of their own country, b%t principilly wool, made up in small skeins called Ce'rias, and some of the inhabitants at this place still gain a subsistence, by the manufacture of it into coarse Punc'his, (blankets.) A great many of the inhabitants were afflicted with large tumors in the neck, which they ascribe to the - qualities of the water; but there are no snowy moun- tains in the neighbourhood, nor would it appear that any.of these springs or rivulets proceed, or derive in- crease, from any hills of that description. 1 1 th.

This was formerly a place of some note ; but it is , now coinpletely in ruins, and without inhabitants. . Half of it belongs to the Gerwcil and half to the Ca- ma'iin district. We now considered ourselves beyond I ! the reach of the Srinugar chiefs ; as the mountain, on which we were encamped, forms the boundary of their jurisdiction in this quarter. Near to this ,place, we passed a large village, called Chaparang, where there is a Jhtila over the river. 13th. Therm. 66'. Heavy rain in the night, but the morning proved sufficiently clear to enable us to see two snowy peaks ; the highest of which bore N. 32' E. and its angle of elevation 8" 30'. Another, to the west of it, bore N. 29' 49' E. with an angle of 70' 7'. They appeared to be about. ten miles from us in horizontal distance. - I I , Marched to Baidya-ndt'h, a village which derives I its sppellation from a large temple, erected here, in I honour of the deity of that name. This building has the appearance of.g.reat antiquity ; but is now in a . very ruinous condit~on, and no longer appropriated - I to sacred worship ; being converted into a house for SURVEY. OF TH.E GANGES. 558 cattle, The images which. it formerly contailled are lodged in a smaller edifice, apparently as, ancient, and built in the center of a 'square, at the angles of which are several inferior temples, in a very dilapi- dated state. The idols assembled here, compose a large propor- tion of the Hindu pantheon : the most conspicuous among them were BHAWA'N~, <span class="loc">GANE</span>'<span class="loc">SA</span> andvrs~~u. The temple stands on the left side of the Gdumat'hi river, across which a bank, or causewayLof stones has been raised, to dam up the stream, which has the appearance of an artificial pond. The water finds a passage through the stones ; but within the enclo- sure it is sufficiently deep for the purposes of bath- ing. A number of large fish, of different kinds, are preserved in it, and daily fed, by the R14hmens and Fukirs. An annual festival is held here, during the time of the Haridlodr fair ; and is numerously attend- ed, bv people from all parts of the hills. The village contains only eight or ten houses, inhabited princi- pally by Gosains; but there are also a few <span class="loc">Canyu</span>- cubja Brdkmer~s, who have charge and superintend- ence of the temple. The village stands on the banks of the Gaumut'hi, which falls into the Sa~jh, or G'hdgru river, at a place called Bahkser. In the commencement of this day's march, we ascended the Chiring G'hdt. In one hour and ten minutes we gained the summit, on which a small pile of stones denoted to the traveller a temporary cessatioii from his labours. To the branches of the surrounding trees, small scraps of cloth and tattered shreds had -been suspended, by the passengers, in token of their satisfaction, or as offerings to the divinity, in whose honour the Tu~~wlus is erected. These rude struc- tures are distinguished by the name of Deotas or Dk- vatas, and are to be met with at the top of almost all the steep ascents, to mark the summit, and call down the grateful effusions of the traveller, who is perhaps 354 8UR11Y OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. &amp; . never more inclined to offer up his thanksgivings. than on these occasions. The bill people regard these places as sacred, and never fail to show their re. spects, by a reverential obeisance. A short distance beyond this Dkcata is a Chulrtitm, which denotes the boundaries of the Gerrccil and Camdon dkthcts, As we proceeded, the road became wider and better. and the prospect opened around us on every side. Our feelings were in perfect-union with the scene, and we experienced a pleasure to which we had for some days been strangers. Our minds were now re- lieved from anxiety, by the idea of having escaped from a land of tyranny and oppression ; and we con- templated with satisfxtion the surrounding scene?', which our internal sensations, no doubt, tended to embellish. The view was no longer confined within a straightened valley, or bounded by an invidious chain of rugged peaks; but, taking an extensice range over six or seven undulatory ridges, was ter. minated by the horizon, at the distance of twenty 9' thirty miles. The contrast of the two sides of tills Ghdt was too remarkable to pass unnoticed. The hills of' Ca~nu'on appear to rise in a rqular gentle at- clivity, from their bases, and, the soilk of rich earth: -9iving birth to fine verdure and extensive forests- The country divides also into vallies tolerably spa- cious, which the hand of tillage has rendered fertile- The cultivation is more extended, and carried higher up the mountains than in Gerwdl: while the neat little hamlets, dispersed along the foot of the hlllr1 prove its population and riches to be proportionaiJ' greater. So apparent is this difference, that we co~~'" not help stopping every now and 'then, to remark how nature and art seemed to vie with each otherin the varied landscape. On ascending the bank of a pretty streamlet, we arrived at the village of cabr:! part of which belongs to f7arndGn and part to This system of a partition of the villages boideri~g O" s~3tio~~"O.F "I'HE:'G.A NGES. 555 the frontier is still maintained; although it originated during the time of the Rajas, and.was establiehed for the mutual 'securi~ty of the boundaries. :From these villages indemnification was sought, fiorn the adverse party, for any predatory acts of aggfessiori ; but we may conceive the ,institution to have been founded more upon mistrust 'than aoy sound policy ; for, while these joint possessions remained sacred, the adjacent places were not less open to pillage ; and the demand for restitution was not likely to have been made, or granted, in an amicable manner. The two parties, however, placed here, might act as spies, and be a check asainst any open incursion. 14th. Them 718'. The night had been tempes- tuous, and fhe morning set in with heavy rain. When a fair interval was obtained, we commenced our march, and arrived at P'ha'licth, a village con- taining five, or six houses, in one of which, the greater part of our baggage being left far behind, we took up our abode for the night. Lat. 8g0 49' 46". On this day's march we crossed four rivers, viz. ' the Gaumat'hi, in which the water was about waist deep; the Gartida-Gunga, about thirty feet in breadth and three in depth, but very rapid; the Husriil, of which the stream was equally violent, having fallen, immediately above the ford, from a shelving ledge of rock, six or eight feet high ; and the Cdusilu, the water of which was also three feet deep, but the current so strong that it was very diffi- - cult to maintain a footing. Between the Basrzil and this river, we crossed a G'hdt called Cachinnah. About two hundred feet above the base, is a large Chubutru called Masret Chawra; whence, in half an hour, we arrived at a <span class="loc">Mugra</span> called Berhdqn De'o-ca- <span class="loc">Nau</span>. Jt is a square building of stone, about ten feet high, with a flat roof. The bottom of it is a small cistern three or four feet square, supplied with 556 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. water from a spring ; and on each side is a small ve- randah or recess. BERHA'M DE'O is .said to have been a very powerful <span class="loc">Raja</span>, who resided formerly at the town of Baidya-Ndt'A. Whenev'er he sat down to his meals, the water from this spring was for- warded, by a chain of servants, who were constantly kept stationed on the road, solely for that purpose. This tradition may have contributed to support the fame of the water, which is considered to possess some very supelior qualities ; although its appear; ance be such, as neither to excite desire, nor convey an idea of its purity. Near the place where we halted, we were met by a servant of BH~M SA'AHI,.~~~ chief of Al~r~uru, who in- formed us that a letter, dispatched by Lieut. WEBB;, from Bdnjbagiiar, had been received by his master, who had sent a S,hbaddr with two companies of Si- pdhis, to meet us, and deliver the answer. We found them accordingly at the village ; but the Szibhddr deeming the day, which was Tuesday, unpropitious, declined to deliver it till the following one. 15th. Therm. 73O. This day he paid us a visit, and delivered the letter; which, after many profes- sions in the oriental style of compliment, lamented, that, in obedience to positive orders from the court of Napcil, the writer bas obliged to decline our visit -at Ahnhl.a. It concluded with desiring, that we would take the route towards the low country, from whatever place we'might have reached, when the letter should come to hand. Y This answer was by no means so favourable as we expected; and our disappointment on reading the contents was very great; for we had not only a great desire to see the <span class="loc">city of Almlru</span>, but we wished to procure several articles, which we had. omitted to purchase at Srinagar, from the idea of being able to SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 557 obtain them better at the Calndiin capital. Besides these, two very great :objections offered to the route pointed out by Cdsipzir, the first was tlie badness of the road, which our information led us to suppose was infinitely worse than the one we wished to pur- suk ; the second was, that we expected to find the baggage and tents, which we had left at Haridiadr, awaiting our arrival at Rzidrapsir. . As the Shboddr stated himsklf not empowered t6 allow our proceeding by a route which would*lead us through the <span class="loc">city of Al</span>?nLra ; it became necessary to make another reference to the government; and Lieut. WEBB accordingly dispatched another letter, urging the request for permission to continue the journey through Almhru, by all the arguments which appeared likely to secure a compliance ; concluding however, with expressing a hope, that if the ob- stacles to granting that should prove insurmountabie, the chief would be pleased to appoint some other route towards Rddrapzir, leaving Ah~tGra at a dis- tance. As this place was not above fourteen miles distant from the capital, we dupposed an answer might be received in two days at farthest. Yet the reply did not come till the evening of the nineteenth, pttviously to which, a messenger, dispatched by Col. COLEBROOLE, with supplies for us, had arriv- ed, and informed us that our' baggage and tents, which we expected to find at Rhdraphr, awaited our arrival at Ca'sipzir. One of the chief objections to the route, pointed out to us by the chief of Al- - mhru, being thus removed, we were preparing to prosecute our journey in that direction ; notwith- standinq; the Shbaddr stated, that, the matter having been again referred to the government, he could not ' ield us any assistance, till a reply should come to Xand. The chiefs reply, however, having appoint- ed us.a meeting at Dhdriles, situated at the distance of three Cls from AlmGra, and it being still an ob- 558 SU.RVEY QF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. ' ject of the survey to ~roceed by the route of Rzidra- phr, we prepared to follow it ; and immediately dis- patched a messenger, to conduct our tents and bag- gage to the G'lldt, by. which we should descend. 90th. Therm. 72. , Marched to Gurcandah. Tlie road lay in great part along the banks of the Cauda; 1. ~t was in general good, and the. ascents gradual. At the distance of every one or two miles, small stone benches were ,erected, near the .road, under the shade of a fine spreading tree, enticing the wearied traveller to rest. These conveniences, however, are only to be found in the roads much .frequented by the Gurc'hdlis, who most probably first instituted them for their own comfort and accommodation, Another practice, very general, and, of more public utility, is that of constructing small stone buildings, somewhat resembling pavillions, 'over a spring, or clear drippling rill. In the centre is a cistern, which coptains the water, and on each side a small-porch. This kind of reservoir is extremely common, and very useful to the traveller, who may find both shel- ter and good. water. .c- We passed to-day in sight of a large fort;called Cdla Mundi, situated on a high flat hill, bearing about E. S. E. and distant eight or nine miles. It is .said to be a fortification, extending over a wide ' space of table land, and large enough to ~ontaia ooe thousand men. We were not sufficiently near to ex- amine it ; but the outer wall appeared to be carried round the edge of the mountain. It was made during . e the time of the Rajas, and is now much out of repair, and unoccupied by a Gurc'hdli garrison. 91s(. Therm. 74'. Very heavy rain in the night. We niarched to Dhdmea, the place appointed for a meeting with BH~M-<span class="loc">SA</span>'H~, the governor of Alnthra. It is situated on the top of a ridge, in a large recess I I I i SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. 559 of the mountain, and contains tbi.rty or forty good huts. Lat. 29' 35' 10" N. In the commencement of this ,day's march, we as- cended a hill, whence we had a distinct view of the fort of Ldlmadi, and part of the <span class="loc">city of Alrnhra</span>. The former bore S. 20 E; and to the N. E. of it stands the capital, built, on the top of a, large ridge of moun- tains. The houses are much scattered, extending down theslope on epch side ; but our view of .it was too distant,@ enable us to convey a more minute. de- scription of the place. It is said to be. more extensive and populous than Srinagar, as.also a place of greater traffic. The inhabitants are .chiefly foreigners, or de- scendants of emigrants from the low lands. On descending the hill, we arrived at a large1 stream, called. the Tonghurl Nadi, which falls into the Causila,, ahou t a quarter of a mile to the S. S. W. Hence there was a tolerably steep ascent for half an hour, which brought us to the village of Catdr~~t.al, inhabited principally by Pataris or dancing wonlen. Above. the town, under a peak' of the .mountain, stands a lqrge, and apparently a very ancient temple, sacred ,to ADITYA. It is built at the W. extremity of a square, and surroun'ded by fifty-one smalleg p~ramidi~a.1 temples, which were formerly allotted for the reception of idols; but few of them remain in a perfect state, and most of the images are with- drawn from them, and collected in the principal . temple. Tradition reports it to have been built. by the Pdndzig. On a small spa* of flat land, adjoining 'to it, an annual fair is held, in the month af Puush. From hence, the'<span class="loc">city of Ahd</span>~a appears directly op- posite, bearing S. 35 E. distant about three miles. . oed. ~herm. 73'. -This euqeing we. received thk visit .of BHIS SA'H~, who had left Almlru at t$n . o'clock in the forenoon; bnt a heavy fall of rain, and - 560 SURVEY OF THE <span class="loc">GANGES</span>. the consequent swelling of the Causila, which he . had to cross, retarded his progress so much, that he did not reach our encampment till five o'clock. He is a tall, stout, good looking man, about sixty years of age; although, frorn his healthy appearance, he might be supposed at least ten years younger. His manners are affable and conciliatory ; he talks the Hindustdnt language tolerably well; but he has a quick mode of expression, and a sinsular impediment in his speech, which renders it rather difficlilt at times to comprehend him. He is the elder brother of HASTI <span class="loc">DHAL</span>, and uncle to the young <span class="loc">Raja</span> of Nupdl. About the time that RAN <span class="loc">BEHA</span>'DUR went to Rmares, BHLM S AH] was detached, op some po- litical mission, to Calcuttu; where he acquired an insight into the customs and manners of Europeans, for whom he professes to entertain a great partiality. He is considered, by the natives, as a man of univer- sal talents ; and is said to have a great turn for me- chanics, to the practical part of which he devotes most of his leisure. From the ascendency which the party of the Tuppas had gained in the counsels of the young <span class="loc">Raja</span> of Gz~rch'ha, he had been superseded in his office by REWART SINH Ku'A, a chief of that party. As BH~M SAH~ is more esteemed, in his public situa- tion, than apy other chief, his removal appeared to cause general regret. 23d. Them. 7a0. Marched to <span class="loc">Chupra</span>. Our road lay at first over successive small ridges, be- tween which were numerous streams and water courses ; and the remainder was a continued de- scent, to Baghar G'ha't on the banks af the Cazc- silu. The breadth of the stream is twenty-five or thirty yards, and the current very rapid. There being no ford, we were detained for a consi- derable time, in collecting, from the neighbouring . .6UBV$Y OR THB 6ANGEI.

It belongo to the Mdwdtis, who have formed a small colony in these forests, and levy a contribution, on all goods and passengers, on their way to and from the hills. An annual fair is held here, in the dry season, ta which the hill people bring thek merchandise for sale, or to exchange it for the low land productions. I At this place, which is the limit of the Gurc'lrdlf territories, our escort took their leave. I 27th.

He happened to be absent I at this time; but his son, GOMAN-SING-CUMA'P, paid us every attention ; and, understanding our bag- gage was coi~siderably in the rear, he o~dered hid own tents to be pitched for our accommodation. We expected to meet here our servants, who had been left behind at Haridwcir, but the heavy continued rain had thrown numerous obstacfes in the road from Ca'sipzir, and it was supposed that camels would be 4 unable to travel ; we therefore dispatched a man, to bring up our horses without delay, and to &amp;sire our' serirants to join us at <span class="loc">Bareli</span> with dl practicable ex-. yedi tion.
