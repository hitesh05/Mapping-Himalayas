'The fort of * Jasntgeth is not f'dr diflant on the oppolite fide, and the road to Skina~r croEs the river a 1ic:le way below the village.

On our way to this point we ~affed through one or two villages, but the cultivation is neither extenfive nor promifing.

Prom hence we entered on a .very deep clefcent into the bed of a fmall but .rapid Rrearn, called ~~t'~r~~i'-G~'d''h~ The valley. or hollow . of which this forms. the drain,. is. fibgularly formed by the meeting of . two hills, .or ranges by a hail ridge, no great dilfance from the river ; and the mwth is far. more narrow than the.hollow above.

This villageis clainled both by Gwxuhal and Sirmor ; it cultivates the lands of each flaw, and P ays tribute to both ; it feems entirely appropriated .to the.mainteMnce of fev&al temples, and their prielts, and there are Iome fine rich b P ieces of land on the bank8 of the Jumla, as well rs of a nullah, a &rc t . \ray further on, fet aiide for tiis holy purpore ; for which the village is affefled by each itate.

One curious Rone reprerents in relief a large affemblage of Hindu divinities, among whom GANE'S'A, DUBGA; BHAVA'NX Bc. &c. sere readlly recogi. nifed. A narrow cavern leading under ground through the rock from the village to the river fide, ufed, it is faid, by the people of the country in times of danger, was ihcwn us, but we did not explore it. Opposr TE to this vl~lage, Barni-Ci-Ga dmh, a large firearn which has its rife in the lofty peak of Bongi-Ca-Tiba dabouches into the 3;rm,,d. In the Rnvine we obferved a curioufly Stuated houle, or fort, built upon afmalt rocky eminence, quite infulared in the middle of the firean. Its name was Biraltu; and it belonged to a zemindar of fome conre- quence, BHU'V SINH. OUR roite now lay alopg fome table land juR on the river bank : paGng ~andcr~crri, a ruined fort on a (mall r~fing ground above th- road, we defcended to Nccrpl-Ci-~i~d'h, which fiream is raid to bc r he boundary between Go-wbal and Sirmor ; but there appears to be a fort of land debateable around LaRha-a-,ncmdal, which contains fcme ipots of land, far richer than that generally met wilbin the hills, Nciaf- Cit.Ga'di is very confiderable, and is Said to take its rife in I'hir-a>z.~a. Tt'ba, nearly two days journey to the N. W.; its immediate bdnhs are rocky and wooded, and much fine alder wood grows on them, as weli as on thofe of the Jwnna. AFTBR a harp afcent up a bare rocky hill, a rough path along its Â£ace brought us to Bauc'hauli, a large aqd apparently populous village, bjgh above the river, and wheq~ we rested for the night. 1 he place of . . . .

The villa~e has the appearance of having once been more con fi. der~ble; thechief zemindar or Stana' (as he is called) when quefiioned with regard to its population, averred that it had but 28 houCes, and contain about loo inhabitants; but his anrwers were helitating, obrcure and prevdricating ; and I fufpect he believed that the queitions put were preparatory to lome affeffmment or tax, which prevented the &ruth from being told. 1 ihould have thought the village mu[t have full 250 inhabitants ; it is not exaaly a part of any purgunnah, but in lome mealure is attubed to RcwL7tn. AT 7 o'clock nrxt morning we left Banc'hauli', and proceeded Rill dong the left hand face ef the hiil above the ~URLM, following 1 he deep indentings, and long rcn.mds of the vallies, wilh varrous irregular afmntl and del'cents, till, by a very rough and clambering path, we reached the top of Gangani-Ci-Dha'r, in a point called Gangas;- Ca ~'ha't. This 'balcony is very highly elevated, and commands bah and downwards, a moR extenfive and noble view, though par- tially obrcured by clouds. From hence we obtained the firR dillin9 view bf BEnder ~u~,$'h, the mountain, from a part ,of which the Yurnna bas its rire ; it (hews in two peak, both very white in fnow, and of great magnitude and height. The bed of the :3uw7a.looking down- wards,is narrow, deep and rocky, fave where the few grew fpob around Loihn rnaOd;lhl, relieve the eye ; upwards it runs in a far more fertile country, with table land and culrivation on its banks aqd kveral willages i il-hilc the hdb nope more eafily down to tbe level part, ce I 70 B'CCOUNT OF A JOURNEY. 70 THE SOURCES OF TEE; I lered with a variety of foreR foenery, and fpotted with fields.

MTe were however difappointed upon . reaching the ridge, whence it was thought it might be fin, nothing appeared, rave the lower part of a ravine entirely-of the fame narure as the reR of the country, and which has here the name of S~'ri4a7k Ci-Gab.

Sircd, and from the dnge which forms the orher Gde of the vally, called Remi-Ci-Dhar. JuR at the end of this lait mentioned range, which was in view from the point we flood on, the valley of ~a'ma Serai commences, and runs up to SircoE for a difiance of from 5 to 7 c6s, probably about gmiles ; the direttion, judging from. that of the mountains, and poEion of the points we ice, along with their formation given, may be nearly N.

A rocky ridge divides the large femicirclc before us into two parts ; in the back ground of that bn the left hand, the 'caflern peak cf Bender-puch'h rifes to a prodigi.ous heighth ; whllc from its bm fom itretches down a large hollow of deep how, cut into ravines, and precipices of a fearful heighth, The mountain itfelf exhbits one . huge howy mafs, without lpeck or dlain. ON the right, Surniru Parbat, a peak hardly inferior to Btndcr-~~~h'lr, , forms the center of a fnowy hollow, as rugged'and deep as that to the kft ; from each of thefe, firearns arife, which unite, and form Bhim. ci-Gcid'h ~t a very ihort diRance from hence. As we were but a very fiqrt way from thefe hollows of fnow, we obtained a beiter idea than we had any opportunity to do before, or the vaR thicknefs to which ir has accumulated. . THE hi8 people affurea me, that it muR be 500 cubits, while I was . )oofely. fuppoGng to one of them, that the face of one of the precipi- ces of how was 300 feet ; this lhcws the opinion the natives entertain, but indeed only ~bc wildefi conjetture can be offered, for what mortal can ever reach them ; they are defolate, cheerlefs, and unapproacha- ble; THB journey of to-day, is the firE which has been totally defcrt ; not a houfe, nor a hut, nor any veffige of cultivation, nor trace of man, has-any \n hete appeared ; it has been dcfolate throughout ; but the hills have been particularly verdant, and the paRure very rich ; not' only a variety of grfles covered tht ground, but a profufion of the. lovelieit flowers burfting through this green carpet gave the liveliefi eff& to every nope and bank ; the beauty of the thiitles qnd ferns, was particularly confpicuous, and cowflipr, polyanthufes, orchiles and .1 G . . s 206 ACCOUNT OF A JOURN-EY TO THE SOURCES or THE lillies of every colour and fpecies were in great profufion. Among other ihrubs, to-day we remarked the common juniper, eafily recog- ' nifed by its berries and CmeJL July I~.-THE morning was cold and foggy; by a little after dby lighe- we were in motion, and continuing our'courfe to the very top ofthc glen, croffed Cinil-cAGad'h, jut? as it leaves the boforn of fnow below Bcndcr- fich'h, upon a bridge of ice ; hence crofsing the point Formed by the- junnion of' the two water courfes, we palfed many of the fmall Rreams that form this eaiternmofi branch of the BAh d-Gdd'h, and commenced; i very difficult ifcent along the principal-one which fallr here 6om a large rnafs of fnow and continues to run under it ; this. was an exceed&- ! ingly painful part of our. road, as the afcent was very itecp and flippery. The ground was here bare and the grafi Runted, yet there were Rill plenty of flowers ; a. litrle further on, vegetation decreafes nil1 more; hardly sty-' thing being- ken, where the. ground 3s bare of how, fare a fcanty green sflime and brown mofs, like that found on barren ,damp grounds: A baron or hoilbw was here formed in the mountain of fnow, and the ruins of the- peaks around, heaped on- each other. It .was exceedirlglp cold, and a: moderate warmth even, was. only preferved by the toilfome exelrife of climbing thefe heighths. Many of the cooleys, and feveral of the fepoys, both GorR'hb and Mmsti now began to lagi and were hdrdiy able to proceed; and every one complained. of, the poifon'd wind. I.now began to IufpeA that tiis C~lppored poilon was nothing more than theeffe&, whichthe rarefied nate of the' air, from the great heighth-we have reached, has on the lungs, and this fup-- pofition 1 .;is led to -frame from my own fcnf,tions ; I could hardly command firength .enough to climb the Recp rocky path, and expcrien- ccd in breathing much difficulty and.opprefGon, as'if there were an in- f~lffrciency of air. I do net. that we could- long have borne it, had 30MNA AND BEA*G~'RAT~HI' RIVERS. 307 tbc afcent continued much further. In this baron we paged a finall pool of water, held very ficred ;' it's name is ~itri.ci'-~dl, and &om ib the chief Qeam of Rhim-ci-Gad'A iku: it is filled with ice and furrounded with fnow, Fsoaa -hence we paired over another hollow and fleep afcent of Bow, which lies deep on mallis of bare rock, and reached the top of the ridge called BanffirL-d-Ghdt. The cold was very great, and it was painfdto remain any time in inaaion, yet every one was indifpof- cd to move, and a- tendency to fleep was very perceptible. The moa ment that any one who complained much of the oppreflion at EircaE lay down4 hc inItantly dropt deep, and wgs with difficulty roufed.

IF the lirie can be drawn with any .degree, of%xa8nefs, the bottom oE this afcent appears the extreme hcighth to which vegetation extends. At. the top, ,thest is not even the dull. mob or. lichen feen below ; the nones are bare. and unchanged, except by the air ; and no fign of life appears, .except a few rchlfs, andthele Bcw together in coveys, . - THIS being probably the highen point to which. we were likely ta r aicend, I %took particular notice of the rocks which compofed the mountains: -fragments.of.which chiefly formedsthe ridge we flood up- ' on. .

Here, as at Jarnnotri, we were told, that no mortal ha, can go fur- r rhcr in its bed towards its iource, than this fpst", ad this difficulty is indeed fufficiently apparent. 'I made a' trial to gain a point about twelve furlongs off, beyond the temple, for the purpofe of obf'ing *the courfe of the river, and of leeing Gungotri ixi another point of view ; -but having, with confiderabla diffic&yy mr& ray way for fome dif- -tame over the anfleadg fragments, at the ri& d being precipitated into the Rrearn, I was forced to turn back ; beyond that point, the y recipices.defcend more abruptly to fht watci's edge.: and, in all prw %ability, it -would be nearly impofible M make my along their faces. Crofing the ftream, to take advantage of ;the eafier places that may oc- fur oa either fide, is out of the queltion : it is too iarge and wid ;- and climbing higher up the mountain fide is equally fo, for the crags increafein ruggedncfs and kepnefs till they end in .tiow. It may be, that enterprifing perbns remaining at chis' fpot fdr kved days Pt weeks, might e~plore or form a path towards the foarp, for time and patient perfeverance can do much, and has in fa& formed the pqh hither ; but I am convinced net only of the diacdty of. the kbrsg it- felf, but that it would not be eafy to overcome the relnaancc of tbc hill people to arcend, whofe affifiadc would be Zo neoeffary 10 kin- , gers, and whom Kuperfiition and religious prejdke ha* hkbcrm .- kept below. 1 bg , , '? .'T - .

L all this may be added, that the Arearn of the Bhigirat'G, .though hre and rapid, is perhaps not greater than may be accounted for ly the large mafs of inow that fupplics it, aAed on by rain and inu. &t a time of year when both have greateft effea; and that few itreams of any confequence jdn it above the 3'ahocai ; the Shcqwi- Gad'll, the Miuni Gad'h, the Bottgi Ga'd'R and the CJkr Gangd, being the only ones from the fouth eaR, while from the north welt side, not a single Rream larger than a men rill, falls into it ; all of which renden it probable, that few if any notiah unite with I he river above &ng% trj, and that it really is formcd as above dekribed. r ZT has been f'aid, that the appearance of %he bed of the .river and hills clofing up our view confirmed the information we received. About two furlongs beyond Gaqotri, a -point on the left gram the northward huts out the immediate view of the Aream ; beyond this, probably about one mile, (or krs of horizontal difiance) a point from the fouthward Qretchu down behind the former, hiding a iarger and bigher portion of the bed and fides; beyond this the courfe is to all appearance itraight for a confiderabie way to the hthward of ca% and a very rough craggy ridge hooting into harp points forms the eaRern bank, and ends i4 a point, round which the rivex again appears to turn, and which firetches down from Swcrgdrohinl. w - JtlMNA mn .BQA'~~'RAT,HI* RIVER%-. 599, $-m~a&no~r~~' is .the neareft .of the five peaks, and forms the mfiera point of, the great fnowy h~llow.

The mountains in this day's march h~ve loR ff ill more of their rough ravage appearance ; they nope occalionally more towards hair bafes, and are frequently wooded far up : cultivation is more corn-' mon, villages more frequent, and the predominating cotours 3 of green and yellow, give a far more cheerfull caR to a couotry, that howeves om only Seem lcfr wild by contrati with &at we have-kft.

In the one we were about to enter on, we were in- formed that, confiderable ohflacles would prefeot themrelves from the rile of one or two laqe nullahs, the temporary bridges of which had been carried awly by the floods. Direttions were given to ere& others , for our pa(Tage, but the indolence and natural flownefs of thefe peo- ple, in the common bufineh of life, is fo great, that we coald place lit- tle reliance on their exertions, and we let off without any certainty of reaching Barahit that night. THE manufaQures of B'hcr are remarkably iuperior to thofe d Rewaen and Tamaur both in material and workmankip; the blankets and woollen fluffs of the former, arc frequently of great finenefs, clofc in texture and of confiderable beauty, while thok of the latter arc coarfe, unGghtly and bad ; the wool of the former, is of a fineneh equal to lome of our beit En-$ilh WCC~~~ while the produce of the' latter cou::trier appeals to partake of the charaAer of hair, and the thread fpun from it is brifily flubborn, and rather calculated to produce a coarf:: hair clo:h, that] any comfortable warm woollen fabrick; the reaibn of this difference, is even lefs explicable than that of others, and it is to be feared has its origin only in natural indolence and floth. For paflure at all events is equally good in Rewacn as in Bzjhtr, and one breed of iheep would in all probability thrive there as well as ;mQther, Eceing that they iucceed perfew well in a Gmilar climate. THU fuperior Itate of agriculture was notorious in every diRria of Bi/k through which we pafkd, and cannot entirely, though it may in loqns meafure, .be referre& to themore untoward and imprdticable natrrwf the ,countries now uder difcuff~on. Tk hou his tbe for- mcr are alfo more calculated for codort in gcneral than tbdc of the latter, though this difference is more perceptible, internally than exter- nally. THE circumffances in which thCb countties 'or diRriQs are placed, +though they appear to be pretty iirnilar, differ perhaps in fome points ; and it is but fair to Itate them, as it is psffible the difference of charaaer, above remarked, may in rome degree at iealt bc refcrrtd to them. Tw a Gorc'h have ruled in Grrwhlil for near twelve years, previous to which a' revere contefi had been maintained, which drained the coun- try of men and money. They appear to have borne in mind, in their iubfequent condua to this unfortunate State, the trouble it con them to win it, and aaed as if determined to revenge it. f ts ola families were defiroyed ; all thofe perfons of rank and importance who were taken, were murdercd,or banifhed ; its villages burnt or defirayed ; and great inumbers of its inhabitants were fold as naves. 'The remaining part were opprefied by heavy taxes: and many voluntary banilhments and -emigrations took place, to avoid a tyranny too opprefive to be borne, ' and too powerful to be withltood. Thus, throughout great part of :Gerwha'l, the traveller fees but the ruins of villages, and the-traces of -former cultivation now abandoned,: while$ the inhabitants that remain, are, in a11 probability, the moR ignorent and the lowefi ; and it may fairly be prefumed, have funk lower ,in exertion and mind, from the oppreflion they have groaned under. THE Gorc'ha~ have only fucceeded in rubjeaing the itate or province *of Byeher, within thefe 3 or 4 years paR, and its fubjeaion was far lefi .complete than that of Gt~wh&Ia The conquerors have had iefs time, let ~~~ortunity. ad probably faw that they dared lcfs to dcffrq the country and villages, or murder and difperle the inhabitants ; the re.

FROM hence, we obtained a lhort Ian glimpk of the faoy hills, and of the peak OF Benderpzc~h'h. Ratr'dwir too was reen, and fever21 other points we could not certainly identify.
